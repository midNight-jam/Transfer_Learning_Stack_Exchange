"403","How can I keep pasta from sticking to itself?","<p>Whenever I boil pasta (specifically spaghetti), it always sticks to itself before I'm ready to use it. What can I do to avoid this without it becoming mushy (which happens if I keep it in the water)?</p>

<p>Of course, if I happen to have the sauce done by the time the pasta is ready <em>and</em> am ready to serve it, I can immediately add the sauce and it's a moot point. But I inevitably screw up the timing and have the pasta sitting there cooling, and then it becomes impossible to separate...</p>

"405","Making (or substitute for) ricotta cheese?","<p>Some of my favorite dishes call for ricotta cheese, be it anything from a lasagna to cannoli. Arguably, this is a very easy thing to find in the States (and presumably elsewhere), so I'd never thought about it. But, living in Japan, I have yet to find it anywhere - supermarkets, import shops, or cheese shops. (Mind you, cheese is a pretty rare thing here, and a delicacy at that.)</p>

<p>So, being unable to buy it anywhere, what are my options? Is there a substitution I can try, or is it something I can make at home?</p>

<p>I did some experiments. I have tried soaked and unsoaked beans from the same batch. There was <strong>no difference</strong> in cooking time, taste, structure or color. Even farts were the same!</p>

<p>Also, one time I read an interview with a cook that makes famous bean soup and he confirmed my findings. He said that he also experimented and he doesn't find a difference.</p>

<p>So what is the reason for soaking beans before cooking? What does it change?</p>

<p>But recently I heard Gordon Ramsay saying that you should never use a spin dryer, that it will destroy the lettuce.</p>

<p>Is that true? How is it destroying the lettuce. I don't see any difference between spin-dryed and un-spun lettuce.</p>

"469","Fresh basil storage","<p>How should fresh basil be stored? The packaging suggests that the optimal temperature is around 50°F, but I can't think of anywhere in an average kitchen at that temperature. A pantry is too warm, and a fridge is too cold. So which of the two is lesser of two evils? I recently had a whole pack get moldy after one use, and it was in the pantry. I think I'm going to start storing it in the fridge now and deal with whatever quality loss I get, unless there's a better solution.</p>

"474","Did I store these potatoes incorrectly (found a bug inside)?","<p>I have a 3 pound bag of 'Idaho' brand potatoes that I bought a few weeks ago. They all looked good (firm and no sprouts) when I went to get them the other day except for one. This one had a white patch on it about 2 centimeters in diameter, and then a small red insect just crawled out of it! It was about a centimeter in length and was very dark red in color. </p>

<p>So my questions were:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Have I been storing these incorrectly? I have them in a kitchen cabinet since that is the darkest place I have and left them in their original bag.   </p></li>
<li><p>Is it safe to eat the other potatoes? I threw the one in question out, but I am wondering if it's a good idea to throw the others out as well.</p></li>

<p>But do I really <strong>need</strong> a slow cooker to pull this off?  It seems like such a basic concept - simmer and/or steam at low heat.  What's so special about these devices?  For kitchens with very limited space, can a slow cooker be ""synthesized"" from other cooking implements, or is there really no substitute?</p>
