"1","What is spin as it relates to subatomic particles?","<p>I often hear about subatomic particles having a property called ""spin"" but also that it doesn't actually relate to spinning about an axis like you would think. Which particles have spin? What does spin mean if not an actual spinning motion?</p>
"
"2","What is your simplest explanation of the string theory?","<p>How would you explain string theory to non physicists such as myself? I'm specially interested on how plausible is it and what is needed to successfully prove it?</p>
"
"3","Lie theory, Representations and particle physics","<p>This is a question that has been posted at many different forums, I thought maybe someone here would have a better or more conceptual answer than I have seen before:</p>

<p>Why do physicists care about representations of Lie groups? For myself, when I think about a representation that means there is some sort of group acting on a vector space, what is the vector space that this Lie group is acting on? </p>

<p>Or is it that certain things have to be invariant under a group action?
maybe this is a dumb question, but i thought it might be a good start...</p>

<p>To clarify, I am specifically thinking of the symmetry groups that people think about in relation to the standard model. I do not care why it might be a certain group, but more how we see the group acting, what is it acting on? etc.</p>

"15","What experiment would disprove string theory?","<p>I know that there's big controversy between two groups of physicists:</p>

<ol>
<li>those who support string theory (most of them, I think)</li>
<li>and those who oppose it.</li>
</ol>

<p>One of the arguments of the second group is that there's no way to disprove the correctness of the string theory.</p>

<p>So my question is if there's any defined experiment that would disprove string theory? </p>

"19","How's the energy of particle collisions calculated?","<p>Physicists often refer to the energy of collisions between different particles. My question is: how is that energy calculated? Is that kinetic energy?</p>

<p>Also, related to this question, I know that the aim is to have higher and higher energy collisions (e.g to test for Higgs Boson). My understanding is that to have higher energy you can either accelerate them more, or use particles with higher mass. Is this correct?</p>

"24","Does leaning (banking) help cause turning on a bicycle?","<p>I think it's clear enough that if you turn your bicycle's steering wheel left, while moving, and you don't lean left, the bike will fall over (to the right) as you turn. I figure this is because the bike's momentum keeps it moving in the direction you were going, and since your wheels have friction against the ground, the top of the bike moves forward relative to the bottom of the wheels. The top of the bike going north while the bottom of the wheels go northwest will understandable cause you to topple.</p>

<p>So to counteract this and keep you from falling over, leaning into the turn is necessary.</p>

<p>But is there also a causal relationship -- that leaning will <strong>cause</strong> the bike to start to turn? If I start leaning left, I will turn left... but maybe that's because I know that if I don't turn the steering wheel left, the bike will fall over (to the left). I experimented with unruly turns of the steering wheel when I was a kid, and got my scrapes and bruises. Now that I'm a cautious and sedate adult I'm not anxious to experiment that way. :-)</p>

<p>(I also want to ask why airplanes bank into a turn... they don't have the same issues as a bike, i.e. the bottom part has no special friction against the ground. But that would probably make the question too broad.)</p>

"26","Velocity of Object from electromagnetic field","<p>I am wondering if someone could provide me with a formula that would tell me at what velocity a projectile can be launched from something using an electromagnetic field. The idea is much like a rail gun or Gauss rifle, but not exactly.</p>

<p>Just looking to find a formula to determine the speed of the projectile.</p>

"
"27","What is the difference between a measurement and any other interaction in quantum mechanics?","<p>We've learned that the wave function of a particle collapses when we measure a particle's location. If it is found, it becomes more probable to find it a again in the same area, and if not the probability to finding it in the place that was checked decreases dramatically.</p>

<p>My question is about the definition of measurement. What makes a measurement different from any other interaction between two particles (gravity and EM fields for example)?</p>

<p>In reality, almost every particle interacts with any other particle, so shouldn't there be constant collapse of the wave function all the time? If this happens we're right back in classical mechanics, aren't we?</p>
"
"29","How to calculate average speed?","<p>I recently encountered a puzzle where a person drove 120 miles at 40mph, then drove back the same 120 miles at 60mph. The average of the speeds is $\frac{40mph+60mph}{2} = 50mph$, so the total trip time should be $\frac{240mi}{50mph} = 4.8 hours$.  But the trip actually took 5 hours.</p>

"
"35","Where do magnets get the energy to repel?","<p>If I separate two magnets whose opposite poles are facing, I am adding energy. If I let go of the magnets, then presumably the energy that I added is used to move the magnets together again.</p>

<p>However, if I start with two separated magnets (with like poles facing), as I move them together, they repel each other. They must be using energy to counteract the force that I'm applying. </p>

<p>Where does this energy come from? </p>
"
"37","How to check Einstein-like equations on their correspondence with the real world?","<p>Physicists studying the grounds of physics and some mathematicians often come to a theories which are like a general-relativity, but do not coincide with it. Often these theories contradict the real world. What should one do in order to check one of such theories? Which papers/books should one read in order to be able to understand about some mathematical theories, that ""the mathematical theory is nice, but this is not our world""?</p>
"
"41","Impressions of Topological field theories in mathematics","<p>There have been recent results in mathematics regarding Conformal field theories and topological field theories. I am curious about the reaction to such results in the physics community. So I guess a starting place for a question would be something like: Did Atiyah's axiomatization of TQFT capture what physicists feel are important in QFT's? How many more parameters are there to what a physicist would call a QFT or FT in general?</p>

<p>Perhaps I should mention that mathematicians (the ones who dont know any phsyics) think about various Field Theories as things that assign invariants to manifolds that should be sensitive to certain data (depending on the word proceeding field). A lot has been done when you only care about the basic topology of the Manifold you are evalutating your field theory at. Have mathematicians gotten rid of too much for physicists to care? What types of things do physicists want a Field theory to keep track of, what kind of structure on the manifold that is?</p>

"52","How do 2 magnets spin by themselves if positioned precisely?","<p>A few years ago I went to a museum, where there was a board with 2 bar magnets, on a pole each so they could rotate.
If you rotated them so the lined up with the same poles (N) facing each other, they'd repel spinning until the south poles lined up, then they'd repel and spin so the north poles lined up and so. This was without any extra help, once you lined them up they would just keep spinning by their selves. How exactly is this possible that the 2 magnets kept producing kinetic energy?</p>

"68","What causes polarised materials to change colour under stress?","<p>Our physics teacher showed the class a really interesting demonstration. He used two polarised filters in opposite orientations, then he took some antistatic tape and stretched it under the two plates. The resulting image was projected on the wall using an overhead projector unit. </p>

<p>Under stress, the originally clear looking tape (as it looked between the polarised filters) turned all sorts of weird colours, and apparently different colors correlate to different levels of stress. What causes this odd effect?</p>

In particular, trigonometric solutions. </p>

<p>Often research grants in this area cite this as an ""application"" of their research. This being said, many mathematicians (definitely including myself) don't know why these solutions are important. So, I wonder:</p>

"
"78","Why do neutrons repel each other?","<p>I can understand why 2 protons will repel each other, because they're both positive. But there isn't a neutral charge is there? So why do neutrons repel? (Do they, or have I been misinformed?)</p>

<p>The reason why I'm asking this is because, I've just been learning about neutron stars and how the neutrons are forced (as in, they repel) together according to my teacher (he's a great teacher btw, though what I just said doesn't make it seem so). </p>

<p>So I wondered, why they have to be forced by gravity and not just pushed? </p>
"
"79","Is quantum entanglement mediated by an interaction?","<p>You can get two photons entangled, and send them off in different directions; this is what happens in EPR experiments. Is the entanglement then somehow affected if one puts a thick slab of EM shielding material between the entangled photons? Have such experiments been made?</p>

<p>According to EPR experiments measurements of the entangled states are at odds with SR, so based on that I'd assume the answer is ""no""/""don't know"", but any citations would be appreciated!</p>
"
"83","How is squeezed light produced?","<p>Ordinary laser light has equal uncertainty in phase and amplitude.  When an otherwise perfect laser beam is incident onto a photodetector, the uncertainty in photon number will produce shot noise with poisson statistics. </p>

<p>However, laser light may be transformed into a 'squeezed state', where the uncertainty is no longer equally divided between the two quadratures, resulting in a reduction of shot noise.  How is this done?</p>

"90","Is it possible that all neutron stars are actually pulsars?","<p>I'm assuming that what I've been told is true:</p>

<p>We can only detect pulsars if their beams of electromagnetic radiation is directed towards Earth.<br>
That pulsars are the same as neutron stars, only that they emit beams of EM radiation out of their magnetic poles.</p>

<p>So, isn't it possible that neutron stars emit EM radiation in the same fashion as pulsars, just not in the right direction for us to detect it?</p>
"
"93","Does Coulomb's Law, with Gauss's Law, imply the existence of only three spatial dimensions?","<p>Coulomb's Law states that the fall-off of the strength of the electrostatic force is inversely proportional to the distance squared of the charges.</p>

<p>Gauss's law implies that a the total flux through a surface completely enclosing a charge is proportional to the total amount of charge.</p>

<p>If we imagine a two-dimensional world of people who knew Gauss's law, they would imagine a surface completely enclosing a charge as a flat circle around the charge.  Integrating the flux, they would find that the electrostatic force <em>should</em> be inversely proportional to the distance of the charges, if Gauss's law were true in a two-dimensional world.</p>

<p>However, if they observed a 1/r^2 fall-off, this implies a two-dimensional world is not all there is.</p>

<p>Is this argument correct?  Does the 1/r^2 fall-off imply that there are only three spatial dimensions we live in?</p>

<p>I want to make sure this is right before I tell this to my friends and they laugh at me.</p>

"94","What ways are there to measure the local polarization of a laser beam?","<p>Measuring the polarization of a laser beam is a simple enough task if the polarization is the same everywhere. You can even buy commercial polarimeters.</p>

<p>That is, if we describe certain finite irreducible masses $x$, $y$, $z$, etc., then all masses are integer multiples of these irreducible masses.</p>

<p>GNUplot is very pervasive in Physics research. Many of the plots appearing in things like PRL and JPB are made in GNUplot. Why is this the case. There are much more modern tools for doing these types of graphs, and from my uninformed position, it appears that this would be easier. </p>

<p>One obvious and relevant first point to make is that GNUplot is free and opensource. I respect this, but do not expect that this is the primary reason.</p>

<p>I am hoping for answers that specify what GNUplot can do that can be achieved in other programs efficiently, say Mathematica. If there are none of these, and the reason is simply tradition/resistance to change, that is also fine, but I expect there must be some specific tasks one wishes to perform.</p>

"197","How are forces ""mediated""?","<p>I hope this is the right word to use.</p>

<p>To me, these forces seem kind of fanciful (except for General Relativity and Gravity, which have a geometric interpretation).</p>

<p>For example, how do two charged particles <strong>know</strong> that they are to move apart from each other?</p>

<p>Do they communicate with each other somehow through some means?</p>

<p>I've heard some people tell me that they bounce together messenger photons.  So does one electron receive a messenger photon, go, ""Oh hey, I should move in the direction opposite of where this came from, due to the data in it"", and then move?</p>

<p>Aren't photons also associated with energy, as well?  Does this type of mediation imply that electrons give off energy in order to exert force on other electrons?</p>

<p>Every electron is repelled by every other electron in the universe, right?  How does it know where to send its force mediators?  Does it just know what direction to point it in?  Does it simply send it in all directions in a continuum?  Does that mean it's always giving off photons/energy?</p>

<p>I'm just not sure how to view ""how"" it is that electrons know they are to move away from each other.</p>

"198","Do current models of particle physics explain the chemical properties of elements/compounds?","<p>I have a particle system of seven protons and seven (or sometimes eight) neutrons (each formed by their appropriate quarks, etc.) bound together in a state that can be macroscopically described as a nucleus.  If relevant, there are also about seven electrons that are bound to this arrangement.  These particle systems are usually found in pairs, bound to eachother.</p>

<p>Macroscopically, this can be modeled as the elemental Nitrogen ($N_2$), and in other disciplines (such as chemistry), it is treated as a basic unit.</p>

<p>We know that at a certain level of thermal energy, this system of elementary particles exist inert and packed together in what can be macroscopically described as a ""liquid"".  We know that this is this temperature is about 77.36 Kelvin (measured experimentally) at the most.  Any higher and they start repelling each other and behave as a macroscopic gas.</p>

<p>Is there any way, from simply analyzing the particles that make up this system (the quarks making up fourteen protons and 14-16 neutrons, the electrons) and their interactions due to the current model of particles (is this The Standard Model?), to find this temperature 77.36 Kelvin?</p>

<p>That is, if given a wave, a purely physical process that would ""return"" the Fourier transform in some meaningful way.  Like, you gave it a sound wave and you would see, ""Oh, there are a lot of components of frequency 1kHz...a few of frequency 10kHz...some of 500Hz...""</p>

(AFAICT there could be 2 or 3 such axes that turn, each at right angles to the next. If I can simulate 2 axes / 3 rings, that would be sufficient. A general solution for n rings would be lovely. :-) </p>

<p>Simulating the thing turning, with each axis rotating at a constant rate, is no problem. But it would ""feel"" more real if I could apply some realistic acceleration from the interaction between the rings and the mass of the rider.</p>

<p>In the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=aerotrim&amp;page=&amp;utm_source=opensearch"" rel=""nofollow"">Youtube videos</a>, you sometimes see a bystander push on one of the rings, to help get the rider going. Not only does that ring accelerate, but others start spinning too. And the pushed ring does not accelerate smoothly, but undergoes resistance from the other rings, apparently transferring acceleration to them.</p>

<p>I am not up on angular momentum, torque, and all that, so answers will need to take my ignorance into account, though I'm obviously willing to learn a few things as necessary. </p>

<p>I don't feel like it's necessary to take into account the asymmetry of the person's mass - modeling the person as a point mass in the center of the rings should be fine, I think. In other words I don't plan on modeling the way that the rider accelerates the rings by leaning one way or another.</p>

<p>I was thinking that in order to make things a little more interesting, I would have the program occasionally apply a force like a hand pushing on one of the rings. I can figure out what the torque on that ring would be if it were independent of the others, but I don't know to model a set of 3 rings connected on axes.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on how I could model the interaction between the rings, each affecting the others? Simplifications are fine. My intent is not to discover new phenomena through accurate physical modeling, but to create a visual display that <em>looks</em> more realistic than just rings turning at constant rates.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> </p>

<p>P.S. Part of my uncertainty is, how much does the Aerotrim really behave like a gyroscope? The gyroscope's main properties are focused on the mass in the middle spinning fast on its axis, and therefore its axis tends not to move. This is obviously different from the aerotrim, where the person is often not rotating much around the inner axis, and the inner axis is certainly not staying still. I wonder if other factors, like the conservation of angular momentum of the <em>outer</em> rings, plays more of a part in the Aerotrim that is negligible with gyroscopes.</p>

<p>If it <em>is</em> essentially just a gyroscope... I've looked at the ""fundamental equation"" at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope#Properties"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope#Properties</a>, but as a non-physicist I find it difficult to imagine how to turn that into code computing what happens when a force is applied. Pointers to example code for simulation of gyroscopes would be appreciated.</p>

"234","How should a physics student study mathematics?","<p><strong>Note: I will expand this question with more specific points when I have my own internet connection and more time (we're moving in, so I'm at a friend's house).</strong></p>

<p>This question is broad, involved, and to some degree subjective.</p>

<p>(I started out as a physics-only student, but eventually decided to add a mathematics major. I am greatly interested in mathematics; the typical curriculum required for physics students is not deep or thorough enough; mathematics is more general (that means work!); and it only requires a few more classes. Naturally, I enjoy <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/"">mathematics</a> immensely.)</p>

<p>This question asks mainly of undergraduate-level study, but feel free to discuss graduate-level study if you like.</p>

<p>Please <em>do not</em> rush your answer or try to be comprehensive. I realize the StackOverflow model rewards quick answers, but I would rather wait for a thoughtful, thorough (on a point) answer than get a fast, cluttered one. (As you probably know, <a href=""http://www.bethanyroberts.com/writing_quotes.htm#on%20revision"">revision</a> produces clear, useful writing; and a properly-done comprehensive answer would take more than a reasonable amount of time and effort.) If you think an overview is necessary, that is fine.</p>

<p>For a question this large, I think the best thing to do is focus on a specific area in each answer.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> To Sklivvz, Cedric, Noldorin and everyone else: I had to run off before I could finish, but I wanted to say I knew I would regret this; I was cranky and not thinking clearly, mainly from not eating enough during the day. I am sorry for my sharp responses and for not waiting for my reaction to pass. I apologize.</p>

<p><strong>Re: Curricula:</strong> </p>

<p>Please note that I am not asking about choosing your own curriculum in college or university. I did not explicitly say that, but several people believed that was my meaning. I will ask more specific questions later, but the main idea is how a physics student should study mathematics (on his or her own, but also by choosing courses if available) to be a competent mathematician with a view to studying physics.</p>

<p><strong>What are the primary obstacles to solve the many-body problem in quantum mechanics?</strong> </p>

<p>Specifically, if we have a Hamiltonian for a number of interdependent particles, why is solving for the time-independent wavefunction so hard? Is the problem essentially just mathematical, or are there physical issues too? The many-body problem of Newtonian mechanics (for example gravitational bodies) seems to be very difficult, with no solution for $n > 3$. Is the quantum mechanical case easier or more difficult, or both in some respects?</p>

<p>In relation to this, what sort of approximations/approaches are typically used to solve a system composed of many bodies in arbitrary states? (We do of course have perturbation theory which is sometimes useful, though not in the case of high coupling/interaction. Density functional theory, for example, applies well to solids, but what about arbitrary systems?)</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/top.html"">hyperphysics link</a> Cedric provided looks similar to a diagram that I saw in my physics textbook. This diagram illustrates precession nicely, but doesn't explain why the top doesn't fall. Since the angular acceleration is always tangential, I would expect that the top should spiral outwards until it falls to the ground. However, the diagram seems to indicate that the top should be precessing in a circle, not a spiral. Another reason I am not satisfied with this explanation is that the calculation is apparently limited to situations where: ""the spin angular velocity $\omega$ is much greater than the precession angular velocity $\omega_P$"". The calculation gives no explanation of why this is not the case.</p>

The thing is, none of the many sources I've seen that discredit the Bernoulli effect explain what's actually going on, so I'm left wondering. Why do airplanes actually fly?

<p>Where does this randomness come from? Has physics ""given up"" on the existence of microscopic physical laws by saying that single measurements are not bound to a physical law?</p>

<p>As a side note: repeating the same measurement over and over with the same apparatus makes the successive measurements non-independent, statistically speaking. There could be a hidden ""stateful"" mechanism influencing the results. Has any study of fundamental QM features been performed taking this into account? What was the outcome?</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: since 2 out of 3 questions seem to me not to answer my original question, maybe a clarification on the question itself will improve the quality of the page :-)</p>

<p>The question is about why single measurements have the values they have. Out of the, say, 1000 measure that make a successful QM experiment, why do the single measurements happen in that particular order?
Why does the wave function collapse to a specific eigenvalue and not another? It's undeniable that this collapse (or projection) happens. Is this random? What is the source of this randomness?</p>

On the other hand the Lorentz invariance should break down according to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity"">GRT</a>, so that one frame is preferred - but which one?</p>

<p><strong>So the question is: Who will be older? And why?</strong></p>

<p>And even if there is one prefered inertial frame - the frame of the other astronaut should be identical with respect to all relevant parameters so that both get older at the same rate. Which again seems to be a violation of SRT in which the other twin seems to be getting older faster/slower...</p>

<p>How should one find out what the preferred frame is when everything is symmetrical - even in terms of GRT?</p>

<p>And if we are back to a situation with a preferred frame: what is the difference to the classical Galilean transform? Don't we get all the problems back that seemed to be solved by RT - e.g. the speed limit of light, because if there was a preferred frame you should be allowed to classically add velocities and therefore also get speeds bigger than c ?!? (I know <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity"">SRT</a> is only a local theory but I don't understand why the global preferred frame should not 'override' the local one).</p>

<p>Could anyone please enlighten me (please in a not too technical way because otherwise I wouldn't understand!)</p>

It was first postulated by the British physicist Paul Dirac in 1930 to explain the anomalous negative-energy quantum states predicted by the Dirac equation for relativistic electrons. The positron, the antimatter counterpart of the electron, was originally conceived of as a hole in the Dirac sea, well before its experimental discovery in 1932.]</p>

<p>and:</p>

<p>[Dirac's idea is completely correct in the context of solid state physics, where the valence band in a solid can be regarded as a ""sea"" of electrons. Holes in this sea indeed occur, and are extremely important for understanding the effects of semiconductors, though they are never referred to as ""positrons"". Unlike in particle physics, there is an underlying positive charge — the charge of the ionic lattice — that cancels out the electric charge of the sea.]</p>

<p>It always confused me to think of holes as positive charge carriers in semi-conductors as <strong>not being real</strong>: real electrons move from one lattice-position to another lattice-position, which effectively <em>looks like</em> a positive hole in the lattice that is moving in the other direction, but in reality a real electron moves, the hole is kind of an ""illusion"".</p>

<p>On the other hand the positrons are always introduced as <strong>real</strong> hard-core particles. </p>

<p>The quotes from the Wikipedia article make me unsure: how should I look upon these phenomena? </p>

"478","Is it possible to project a magnetic field at a location in space?","<p>A magnetic field strength drops-off quickly as the distance from a magnet increases.</p>

<p>Is there any way to use electromagnetic fields to create a magnetic field at a location. For example, if there are strong electromagnetic fields intersecting at a location from many strong transmitters, could a constructive interference be created which creates a local magnetic field?</p>

<p>The engineering idea is that if you create an array of radio transmitters at a strong strength working together, could there be a interference pattern at a point far from the transmitters (maybe 100 meters away) where the fields produce a magnetic field at that location.</p>

<p>I think this could be done as a EM field is composed of a electric field and a magnetic field, shouldn't there be a way to make the magnetic field strong at a location in space.</p>

<p>A positive consequence of this would be that a magnetic placed at that location 100 meters away could be moved by the field. Also, if the field was alternating, rather than steady, then a electromagnet at that location could be alternating, and the force on the electromagnet could provide motive force.</p>

<p>I guess since I have never heard of this, it cannot be done. But then again, it was once said that levitating a normal magnet could not be done, then someone did it with a spinning magnet which levitates above another magnet, now it is a popular toy. The reason it works is that the magnet is spinning so that it cannot flip over. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-stabilized_magnetic_levitation"">spin stabilized magnetic levitation</a>. </p>

<p>--- Update</p>

<p>Hi, I would like to clarify, I wish to move a physical object, a small magnet at a distance, not to transmit power to the object. Thanks!</p>

<p>--- Update 2</p>

<p>My engineering goal for this is a small magnetic, spin stabilized, being pushed from a distant location. A small spin stabilized magnet pushed from below by some ""projected"" magnetic field could potentially overcome the force of gravity. Imagine a thin lightweight spinning disk with a magnet in the center. If a projected magnetic field is pushing it upwards then it would stay stable and could be projected from ground into space.</p>

<p>This might be done with an array of thousands of transmitters on the ground, somewhere in the desert far away from people. All transmitters could focus a small magnetic field at this magnet.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if the magnetic field alternates with a frequency, then the magnet in the levitated device could also be alternating via electromagnetism, it could be powered by an battery or microwave power transmitted to the object. This is more or less an engineering problem if there is some basic science which can allow this to be a potential reality.</p>

"484","Nature of decoupling of matter and radiation","<p>I have a question about cosmology. At popular level people explain the time of decoupling of matter and radiation as the moment when temperature falls enough for nuclei and electrons to recombine into atoms. People say that the Universe became &ldquo;transparent&rdquo;. The photon cross section by an electro-neutral system is smaller than Thomson's one, i.e., technically it means that the mean free path became very large or even infinite.</p>

<p>However, there is another mechanism for the mean free path to become infinite. It is because during its expansion the universe becomes less dense. Let me explain it by example. Imagine that you are in the forest where the diameter of tree is $a$, and mean distance between trees is $b$. What is the mean diameter of the observed area? It is proportional to $b^{2}/a$, I suppose. Now let's imagine that our forest is in the expanding universe, i.e., $b$ grows (linearly, for example) with time while $a$ remains constant. Then at some moment &ldquo;the diameter of the observed area&rdquo; starts to grow faster than the speed of light, i.e., becomes infinite. </p>

<p>It implies that the recombination is not necessary for the decoupling. Did the recombination start earlier than the moment I described above? Or both mechanisms (recombination and density fall) are equally important for the decoupling?</p>

"493","Notation of plane waves","<p>Consider a monochromatic plane wave (I am using bold to represent vectors)
$$ \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},t) = \mathbf{E}_0(\mathbf{r})e^{i(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t)}, $$
$$ \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r},t) = \mathbf{B}_0(\mathbf{r})e^{i(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t)}. $$</p>

<p>There are a few ways to simplify this notation. We can use the <em>complex field</em>
$$ \tilde{\mathbf{E}}(\mathbf{r},t) = \tilde{\mathbf{E}}_0 e^{i(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t)} $$
to represent both the electric and magnetic field, where the real part is the electric and the imaginary part is proportional to the magnetic. Often it is useful to just deal with the <em>complex amplitude</em> ($\tilde{\mathbf{E}}_0$) when adding or manipulating fields.</p>

<p>However, when you want to coherently add two waves with the same frequency but different propagation directions, you need to take the spatial variation into account, although you can still leave off the time variation. So you are dealing with this quantity:
$$ \tilde{\mathbf{E}}_0 e^{i\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}} $$</p>

<p>My question is, what is this quantity called? I've been thinking <em>time-averaged complex field</em>, but then again, it's not really time-averaged, is it? <em>Time-independent</em>? Also, what is its notation? $\langle\tilde{\mathbf{E}}\rangle$?</p>

"503","Open problems in special relativity, and non-inertial motion in flat-spacetime, or things that have been discovered recently","<p>What classical open problems are there in special relativity, including questions about non-inertial motion in flat-spacetime, but excluding questions about quantum theories.</p>

<p>Answers can include things which were open problems until recently.</p>

<p>New things in special relativity (and non-gravitational relativity) still seem to be discovered relatively recently:</p>

<p>For instance the book ""A broader view of relativity"" by Jong-Ping Hsu, Leonardo Hsu, contains formulas for transformations between some types of accelerated frames.</p>

<p>Abraham Ungar derived <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrovector_space"" rel=""nofollow"">formulas</a> for things like proper velocity composition, and for Lorentz transformation composition in terms of velocity and rotation parameters.</p>

<p>So it would be good to have a list of things that we still haven't worked out, or have only been worked out recently, to challenge the assumption that special relativity is all figured out.</p>

<p>(Due to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame-dragging"" rel=""nofollow"">linear frame-dragging</a> it also seems that the usual saying that GR tends to SR in the limit of negligble gravity should be stated as GR tends to SR for negligble gravity and low acceleration, so any calculations concerning the half-way house of non-inertial relativity between SR and GR would only be valid for low acceleration. Perhaps this should be the definition of non-inertially extended special relativity: acceleration without linear frame-dragging.)</p>

<p>Edit: I +1ed the answer on self-force because it was an interesting general issue, but once we are talking about fields and particles then we are getting away from the question which is really about calculations in the theory of special relativity itself. Once we talk about fields and particles then I guess there are lots of problems and an accurate treatment requires quantum theories which this question is not about.</p>

"541","Can the coefficient of static friction be less than that of kinetic friction?","<p>I was recently wondering what would happen if the force sliding two surfaces against each other were somehow weaker than kinetic friction but stronger than static friction. Since the sliding force is greater than the maximum force of static friction, $F > f_s = \mu_s F_N$, it seems that the surfaces should slide. But on the other hand, if the force of kinetic friction is greater than the applied force, there'll be a net force $\mu_k F_N - F$ acting <em>against</em> the motion, suggesting that the surfaces should move opposite to the direction they're being pushed! That doesn't make sense.</p>

"584","What is necessary for a causal set to be manifold-like?","<p>A causal set is a poset which is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive and locally finite.</p>

<p>As a motivation, there is a programme to model spacetime as fundamentally discrete, with causal sets providing the underlying structure. Typically this is constructed by sprinkling (a poisson process) existing spacetime with elements, endowing these elements with an ordering given by causal cones, and removing spacetime. Volume is then given by a counting metric, which with the causal structure is enough to build a geometry. By the poisson nature of this process, the distribution is Lorentz-invariant.</p>

<p>This only makes sense in nature if the causal set is manifold-like, by which we mean it can be faithfully embedded into a manifold, such that the element count gives volume.</p>

"594","Does the friction force change directions with a change in reference frame?","<p>In a basic friction problem with Block A sliding on top of Block B, the direction of the friction force is usually explained as being simply the opposite of the direction of motion. So if Block A is sliding to the right, the friction force is pointing to the left. But this reasoning implicitly assumes that we are calculating friction force from the reference frame of Block B. What if we instead look at the problem from the reference frame of Block A? To Block A, it looks as if Block B is sliding to the left, so an observer on Block A would say that there is a friction force which, to oppose the direction of motion, points to the right.</p>

<p>It seems counterintuitive and probably wrong for the direction of friction force to depend on reference frame like this. Where is the flaw in the reasoning above? Are the two reference frames described above not exactly equivalent in a way that leads to the force changing directions?</p>

"625","Is a ""third quantization"" possible?","<ul>
<li>Classical mechanics: $t\mapsto \vec x(t)$, the world is described by particle trajectories $\vec x(t)$ or $x^\mu(\lambda)$, i.e. the Hilbert vector is the particle coordinate function $\vec x$ (or $x^\mu$), which is then projected into the space parametrized by the ""coordinate"" time $t$ or the relativistic parameter $\lambda$ (which is not necessarily monotonous in $t$).<br>
Interpretation: For each parameter value, the coordinate of a particle is described.<br>
Deterministic: The particle position itself</li>
<li>Quantum mechanics: $x^\mu\mapsto\psi(x^\mu)$, (sometimes called ""the <em>first quantization</em>"") yields <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics"">Quantum mechanics</a>, where the Hilbert vector is the wave function (being a field) $|\Psi\rangle$ that is for example projected into coordinate space so the parameters are $(\vec x,t)$ or $x^\mu$.<br>
Interpretation: For each coordinate, the quantum field describes the charge density (or the probability of measuring the particle at that position if you stick with the non-relativistic theory).<br>
Deterministic: The wave function<br>
Non-deterministic: The particle position</li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory"">Quantum Field Theory</a>: $\psi(x^\mu)\mapsto \Phi[\psi]$, (called the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory#Second_quantization"">second quantization</a> despite the fact that now the wave field is quantized, not the coordinates for a second time) basically yields a functional $\Phi$ as Hilbert vector projected into quantum field space parametrized by the wave functions $\psi(x^\mu)$.<br>
Interpretation: For each possible wave function, the (to my knowledge nameless) $\Phi$ describes something like the probability of that wave function to occur (sorry, I don't know how to formulate this better, it's not really a probability). One effect is for example particle generation, thus the notion ""particle"" is fishy now<br>

<p>Consider (in 1D) two point-like particles connected by a spring (""the molecule""), the right of them being hit by a third particle (""the bullet"") coming from the right with initial velocity $v_0$. Let the molecule be in rest initially. Let all three particles have equal mass $m$.</p>

<p>After the collision took place the bullet will move to the right with velocity $v_b$, the molecule will move to the left with velocity $v_m$ and oscillate with frequency $\omega$ and amplitude $\alpha$.</p>

<p>The total energy of the molecule and its total momentum after the collision are then (I hope I didn't make any serious errors):</p>

<p>$E = \frac{m}{2}(v_1^2 + v_2^2) = m (v_m^2 + \alpha^2\omega^2)$
</p>

<p>$p = 2mv_m$
</p>

<p>The conservation laws yield:</p>

<p>$v_m = \frac{1}{3}(v_0 + \sqrt{v_0^2 - 3\alpha^2\omega^2})$
</p>

<p>$v_b = v_0 - 2v_m$
</p>

<p>Since we know that $v_m \geq \frac{1}{2}v_0$ we get</p>

<p>$0 \leq \alpha \leq \frac{v_0}{2\omega}$
</p>

<p>I.e., the range in which the amplitude $\alpha$ can vary depends on the spring constant $k$ (which is associated with the frequency by $\omega \propto \sqrt{k/m}$): if the spring constant tends to $\infty$ the amplitude must tend to 0 and the molecule must behave approximately like a rigid rod of mass $2m$, as would have been expected.</p>

<p>In any case, the amplitude $\alpha$ is <em>not</em> determined by the conservation laws, only its range of possible values. (This is analoguous to the case of two colliding point-like particles, see answers to <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/614/where-do-particles-go-after-collision"">Where do particles go after collision?</a>)</p>

<p><strong>But:</strong> At least I would see it as unphysical if the molecule would <em>not</em> oscillate after the collision for finite spring constants $k&gt;0$, which is nevertheless allowed by the conservation laws. I cannot imagine an ""inner structure"" or a micro-process taking place during the collision which would produce this behaviour. What results could inverse scattering experiments yield?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How am I to think about this mind-boggling
  puzzle?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Postscript]</strong> In the case of two colliding point-like particles it is easy to specify the dynamics in a most natural way, at least in the case when the two collide with diametrical velocities: ""for symmetry reasons"" their velocities after the collision shall be in the same/opposite direction. (For real point-like particles without inner structure that's the only law/rule that makes sense.)</p>

<p>But now the puzzle continues: Which ""natural"" law could determine the solution of the molecule-bullet-problem?</p>

Since this effect increases as you get closer to the singularity, a star aimed at you could blast you with a billion years of radiation in maybe a second. Of course, no star will be perfectly aligned for billions of years. On the other hand, there is lots of cosmic background radiation coming at you from everywhere in the sky and it will be blue shifted too. So, how bad is it?

"723","Help fill in my understanding of the Polywell fusion reactor","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polywell"" rel=""nofollow"">Polywell</a> is a proposed new type of fusion reactor, which is designed to use magnetic fields to overcome the problems with the Elmore-Tuck-Watson fusor.  I'm trying to understand exactly how it works.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An Elmore-Tuck-Watson fusor ... consists of a vacuum chamber containing a negatively charged outer grid (which may be the chamber) and a positively charged inner grid. Electrons are injected into the system and accelerated toward the inner grid. Most of the time, the electrons pass through the grid, through the core, and through the inner grid again, which then decelerates them and reaccelerates them inward wherein they return through the core. As they pass repeatedly through the core, they generate a negatively charged zone, a potential well, which is called a virtual cathode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> So this device uses a constant high voltage applied to the electrodes to produce a region of negative electric charge in the center.  How is this possible?  Electrons repel each other, so creating a region in empty space in which electrons are more dense than their surroundings would seem to require a constant energy input.  Without any energy input, they'll just fly apart to a minimum energy equilibrium where the charge density is equal everywhere.  Applying a voltage to electrodes with no current flowing between them does not use up any energy, however.  So where is the energy to hold the clump of electrons together coming from?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like the Elmore-Tuck-Watson (ETW) fusor, the polywell confines positive ions through their attraction to the negative potential well which is created by the electrons that are held inside a positively charged grid. However, to avoid the losses related to the electrons striking the grid, the Polywell uses magnetic fields to shield the grid. The magnetic fields are configured in a way that adds to the confinement of the electrons so that there are many more electrons inside the core than outside.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> So the magnetic fields generated by the grid would supposedly prevent the electrons from hitting the grid.  The positively charged inner grid is attractive to electrons, but it's also magnetized, and somehow the magnetic fields repel electrons away from the grid?  But how can unchanging/steady-state magnets confine (or repel) electrons?  A bar magnet doesn't create any kind of movement or displacement of charge.</p>

"727","What condition is fulfilled by the path of a mass sliding down a lumpy hill?","<p>Suppose I have a hill that goes up and down unevenly.

<p>I can find the equations of motion of the point mass and, from  there, find the path by finding the entire time-dependent motion.  Is there a way to find the path directly, given the initial velocity of the particle?  For example, does the correct path extremize something?</p>

"728","Will a ball slide down a lumpy hill over the same path it rolls down the hill?","<p>Suppose I have a lumpy hill.  In a first experiment, the hill is frictionless and I let a ball slide down, starting from rest.  I watch the path it takes (the time-independent trail it follows).   </p>

<p>In the next experiment, the hill stays the same shape, but the ball now rolls without slipping down the hill.  Assume there is no deformation of the ball or of the hill, no micro-sliding of the contact surface, and no other forms of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_resistance"">rolling resistance</a>. Energy is conserved.  I release the ball from rest at same point on the hill.  I track the path the rolling ball takes.  </p>

<p>Does the rolling ball follow the same path as the sliding ball, but more slowly, or does it sometimes follow a different path?</p>

<p>Note: There may be some ""trick"" answers.  For example, if the hill curves significantly on scales similar to  the radius of the ball, the ball could get ""wedged in"" somewhere, or two parts of the ball could contact the hill at the same time.  Let's assume that geometrically, the shape of the hill is such that it is only possible to have the ball contact the hill at one point, and that the ball always contacts the hill at a single point (i.e. it never flies off).</p>

<p>I am looking for a good notation for sections of vector bundles that is both invariant <em>and</em> references bundle coordinates. Is there a standard notation for this?</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>In quantum mechanics, the wave function $\psi(x,t)$ of an electron is usually introduced as a function $\psi : M \to \mathbb{C}$ where $M$ is the space-time, usually $M=\mathbb{R}^3\times\mathbb{R}$.</p>

<p>However, when modeling the electron in an electromagnetic field, it is best to think of $\psi(x,t)$ as a section in a $U(1)$-vector bundle $\pi : P \to M$. Actually, $\psi(x,t)$ *itself* is not a section, it's just the image of a section in one particular local trivialization $\pi^{-1}(U) \cong U\times\mathbb{C}$ of the vector bundle. In a different local trivialization (= a different gauge), the image will be $e^{i\chi(x,t)}\psi(x,t)$ with a different phase factor.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I feel uncomfortable with this notation. Namely, I would prefer an invariant notation, like for the tangent bundle. For a section $\vec v$ of the tangent bundle (= a vector field), I can write $\vec v = v^\mu \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}$. This expression mentions the <em>coordinates</em> $v^\mu$ in a particular coordinate system, but it is also <em>invariant</em>, because I also write down the basis vector $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}$ of the coordinate system.</p>

<p>The great benefit of the vector notation is that it automatically deals with coordinate changes: $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y^\nu}\frac{\partial y^\nu}{\partial x^\mu}$.</p>

<p><strong>My question:</strong></p>

<p>Is there a notation for sections of vector bundles that is similar to the notation $\vec v = v^\mu \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}$ for the tangent bundle? What does it look like for our particular example $\psi$?</p>

<p>If no, what are the usual/standard notations for this? How do they keep track of the bundle coordinates?</p>

<p>A rod of weight P, tilted at an angle of 60° to the plane of a table, begins to fall with initial velocity zero. Find the constraint force of the table at the initial moment, considering the table as</p>

<p>(a) absolutely smooth</p>

<p>(b) absolutely rough</p>

<p>(In the first case, the holonomic constraint holds the end of the rod on the plane of the table, and in the second case, at a given point.)""</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mq3d0.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<hr>

<p>I must admit, I am pretty unsure on how to do calculations using this ""fancy"" mathematical kind of physics.</p>

<p>First off, I'm lost with (a). But I'll have a go at (b):
As far as I understood, d'Alemberts principle states, that if $M$ is a constraining manifold, $x(q)$ is a curve in $M$ and $\xi$ is a vector perpendicular to $T_xM$, then $x$ satisfies Lagrange's equations</p>

<p>$\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot q} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} \qquad L = \frac{{\dot x}^2}{2} - U(x)$
</p>

<p>iff for the following inner product, we have</p>

<p>$\left(m \ddot x + \frac{\partial U}{\partial x}, \xi \right) = 0$
</p>

<p>I guess that's about right so far? The constraint would in this case essentially be $\mathbb S^1$, since the rod moves on a circe around the point in contact with the table. Can we assume that all the rod's mass is at the center of mass?</p>

<p>Would we then have $U(x) = -gx_2$ in this case (where $x_2$ is the vertical component of $x$)?</p>

<p>If yes, then $\partial U / \partial x = -ge_2$. Where $e_1, e_2$ are the horizontal and vertical unit vectors, respectively.</p>

<p>At the inital moment, we have $x = \cos(60&#176;) e_1 + \sin(60&#176;) e_2$, so by d'Alembert's principle we must have</p>

<p>$\left(m \ddot x + \frac{\partial U}{\partial x}, \cos(60&#176;) e_1 + \sin(60&#176;) e_2 \right) = 0$
</p>

<p>or written differently</p>

<p>$m \ddot {x_1} \cos(60&#176;) + m \ddot{x_2} \sin(60&#176;) - \sin(60&#176;)g = 0$

<p>So: Is this correct so far? Or am I way off? Is (a) handled any differently up to this point?</p>

<p>This precession rate had been precisely measured using data collected since the 1600's, and it was later found that Newton's theory of gravity predicts a value that differs from the observed value. That difference, which I am calling the <em>anomalous precession</em>, was estimated to be about 43 arcseconds per century in Einstein's time.</p>

<p>I have heard that general relativity predicts an additional correction that is almost exactly sufficient to account for that 43""/century difference, but I've never seen that calculation done, at least not correctly. Can anyone supply the details?</p>

"815","What categorical mathematical structure(s) best describe the space of “localized events” in “relational quantum mechanics”?","<p>In a recent (and to me, very enlightening) paper, entitled ""Relational EPR"", <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604064"">Smerlak and Rovelli</a> present a way of thinking about EPR which relies upon Rovelli's previously published work on relational quantum mechanics (see <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9609002"">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9609002</a> ). In relational quantum mechanics, there is no non-locality, but the definition of when an event occurs is weakened from Einstein's strict definition and instead is localized to each observer-measurement apparatus, including subsequent observers. There are (informal) coherence assumptions to ensure the consistency of reports from different subsequent observers (all possible friends of Wigner).</p>

<p>All of this seems very similar to various results in modern categorical mathematics. Is there a standard mathematical structure which well describes the structure of the space of localized measurements which Rovelli has envisioned? I know of Isham's work on topos theory and quantum mechanics, but I think he is aiming at something a little different.</p>

"822","Is Angular Momentum truly fundamental?","<p>This may seem like a slightly trite question, but it is one that has long intrigued me.</p>

<p>Since I formally learned classical (Newtonian) mechanics, it has often struck me that angular momentum (and generally rotational dynamics) can be fully derived from normal (linear) momentum and dynamics. Simply by considering circular motion of a point mass and introducing new quantities, it seems one can describe and explain angular momentum fully without any new postulates. In this sense, I am lead to believe only ordinary momentum and dynamics are fundamental to mechanics, with rotational stuff effectively being a corollary.</p>

<p>Then at a later point I learned quantum mechanics. Alright, so orbital angular momentum does not really disturb my picture of the origin/fundamentality, but when we consider the concept of <em>spin</em>, this introduces a problem in this proposed (philosophical) understanding. Spin is apparently intrinsic angular momentum; that is, it applies to a point particle. Something can possess angular momentum that is not actually moving/rotating - a concept that does not exist in classical mechanics! Does this imply that angular momentum is in fact a fundamental quantity, intrinsic to the universe in some sense?</p>

<p>It somewhat bothers me that that fundamental particles such as electrons and quarks can possess their own angular momentum (spin), when otherwise angular momentum/rotational dynamics would fall out quite naturally from normal (linear) mechanics. There are of course some fringe theories that propose that even these so-called fundamental particles are composite, but at the moment physicists widely accept the concept of intrinsic angular momentum. In any case, can this dilemma be resolved, or do we simply have to extend our framework of fundamental quantities?</p>

"862","Does this statement make any sense?","<p>I am asking this question completely out of curiosity. The other day, my roommate, by mistake, used 'Light year' as a unit of time instead of distance. When I corrected him (pedantic, much), he said the following:</p>

<p>""Units are relative. And according to Fourier Transforms, units can be changed so Light year is a unit of time.""</p>

<p>That got me thinking and I read up Fourier Transforms on wikipedia but couldn't find anything about using a unit in one domain as a unit for another measurement. I do agree that units (particularly, base units are relative. eg: the meter), but does his statement make any sense?</p>

<p>EDIT
Thank you everyone for all the answers. It isn't so much to in it in or prove a point as it is to understand the concept better. Anyways this is his response after I showed him this thread. Any comments would be appreciated.</p>

<p>His response:
Nevermind, for the first time I accept I was wrong. BUT using lightyears to measure time is possible. My example didn't make sense bacause I was wrong when I meantioned that I'm still measuring dist. If you have a signal in time domain and ...take the FT, I get a signal which DOES NOT HAVE to be in frequency domain. Clarify this to the guy who posted last. Now the new signal is in a domain defined by me and so is its units. This signal although not equal to the original signal, still represents that if ya take an inverse FT. So, the idea of time will still be there. Now coming back to our case: lightyears here is not the lightyears you are used to read when dealing with distance. It represents time.</p>

"886","Swimming in Spacetime - apparent conserved quantity violation","<p>My question is about the article <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/299/5614/1865"">Swimming in Spacetime</a>.</p>

<p>My gut reaction on first reading it was ""this violates conservation of momentum, doesn't it?"". I now realize, however, that this doesn't allow something to change its momentum; it only allows something to move (change position) without ever having a nonzero momentum. Since this is relativity, there is no simple relationship between momentum and velocity like p = mv, so this is all well and good. An object can move, with a constant momentum of zero, by changing its shape in a nontrivial cycle.</p>

<p>However, now I'm thinking about a different conservation law and I can't see how ""swimming through spacetime"" is possible without violating it. The conserved quantity I'm thinking of is <a href=""http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/boosts.html"">the Noether charge associated with Lorentz boosts</a>, which is basically x - (p/E)t, that is, the position of the center of mass projected back to time t=0. If p = 0, then the conserved quantity is simply x, the position of the center of mass. This obviously contradicts the whole swimming idea.</p>

<p>What's going on here? Is swimming through spacetime only possible if the spacetime is curved in some way that breaks the symmetry under Lorentz boosts? Or is there some error in my reasoning?</p>

"916","Imagine a long bar floating in space. What force does it exert on itself in the middle due to gravity?","<h1>Problem</h1>

<p>If you had a long bar floating in space, what would be the compressive force at the centre of the bar, due to the self-weight of both ends?</p>

<p>Diagram - what is the force at point X in the middle of the bar?:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;----------------------L---------------------&gt;, total mass M
=======================X======================   &lt;- the bar
                 F---&gt; X &lt;---F
</code></pre>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>You should be able to simplify by cutting the bar into pieces, but that gives a different answer depending on how many pieces you use (see below). So the simplification must be wrong - but why?</p>

<h1>My approach</h1>

<h3>Split bar in two</h3>

<p>So, one approximation would be to cut the bar in half - two pieces of length L/2, mass M/2:</p>

<pre><code>         (M/2)&lt;-------L/2-------&gt;(M/2)
           #1          X           #2   &lt;- bar approximated as blobs #1 and #2
</code></pre>

<p>Force at X is G(M1.M2)/(R^2) = G (M/2)^2 / (L/2)^2 = G M^2 / L^2</p>

<p>Or Fx / (G. M^2 / L^2) = <strong>1</strong></p>

<p>But is that really valid? If so, shouldn't you get the same answer if you split the bar into four pieces?</p>

<h3>Split bar into four</h3>

<pre><code>   (M/4)&lt;-L/4-&gt;(M/4)&lt;-L/4-&gt;(M/4)&lt;-L/4-&gt;(M/4)
     #1          #2    X     #3          #4
</code></pre>

<p>My assumption is that the force at X is the sum of the attractions of each blob on the left to every blob on the right.</p>

<p>Force at X = #1&lt;>#3 + #1&lt;>#4 + #2&lt;>#3 + #2&lt;>#4</p>

<p>('&lt;>' being force between blobs #x and #y).</p>

<p>Fx / (G.M^2 / L^2) = (2/4)^-2 + (3/4)^-2 + (1/4)^-2 + (2/4)^-2 = <strong>1.61</strong></p>

<p>This is bigger than the previous result (1.61 vs 1).</p>

<h3>Split bar into six</h3>

<p>Similarly, if you split into 6 blobs, the total force comes out as:</p>

<p>Fx / (G.M^2 / L^2) = (3/6)^-2+(4/6)^-2+(5/6)^-2 + (2/6)^-2+(3/6)^-2+(4/6)^-2 + (1/6)^-2+(2/6)^-2+(3/6)^-2</p>

<p>Fx / (G.M^2 / L^2) = <strong>2.00</strong></p>

<h3>So what's wrong with my approach? And what is the real answer?</h3>

<p>So it seems the more pieces we split the bar into, the larger the result gets. There's clearly something wrong with my assumptions! - but what?</p>

<p>I'd be very glad if someone here could explain this. Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
As Peter Shor pointed out, my calculations had some dodgy algebra and I'd calculated $$L^2/M^2$$ values rather than $$M^2/L^2$$. I've now corrected that - the value still increases as you divide into more masses.</p>

<p>I'll do a bit more work with more divisions and see if this leads to convergence or not.</p>

<p>What is then the situation if there is no external magnetic field to provide the quantization axis? Is ""polarization"" meaningful from the atoms point of view? How one sets out to calculate the interaction strength for the different polarizations in the laboratory frame?</p>

"937","How does gravity escape a black hole?","<p>My understanding is that light can not escape from within a black hole (within the event horizon).  I've also heard that information cannot propagate faster than the speed of light.  It would seem to me that the gravitational attraction caused by a black hole carries information about the amount of mass within the black hole.  So, how does this information escape?  Looking at it from a particle point of view: do the gravitons (should they exist) travel faster than the photons?</p>

"963","Why do we define such a thing as singularity?","<p>According to general relativity, an observer not in the close proximity of a black hole, observing a mass fall into that black hole, will never see that mass cross event horizon(it will gradually fade but never actually pass through the event horizon) as it requires an infinite amount of time to do so. So, effectively, for the observer, the mass of the object falling in will never reach the middle of the event horizon, or the so called ""singularity"", as it will require more-than-infinite amount of time to do so.</p>

<p>Then why do we even define such a thing as a singularity?</p>

<p>I am alright with the singularities in space-time curvature, but not with a finite amount of mass being compressed into zero volume, not because it is silly, because it would never happen in a finite time for a casual observer outside of black hole.</p>
"
"970","If I fall into an evaporating black hole, where do I end up?","<p>This question has been bothering me for a while. I have a crude hypothesis...</p>

<p>As I understand it, an observer falling into a black hole will cross the event horizon at some specific future (proper) time in, and that it will not be a traumatic event if the black hole is big enough (e.g. tidal forces will be quite mild).</p>

<p>Also, an outside observer will never observe the infaller quite reach the event horizon but it does not work the other way. The infaller will not observe times arbitrarily far into the future before crossing the event horizon..</p>

<p>Also, black holes evaporate, which may lead to some caveats about the previous two statements (which do not take evaporation into account).</p>

<p>So suppose we have a large black hole, destined to evaporate and vanish in the the year 10<sup>50</sup> AD. And suppose I jump into it, equipped with a telescope that lets me observe the Earth. Before I reach the event horizon I will see 10<sup>50</sup> AD arrive on earth. At that point I will see astronomers on earth waving flags to indicate that they have seen the black hole vanish. So if I look ""down"" I will see empty space with no black hole looming. So where am I? If I'm just adrift in space, am I in a cloud of all the other objects that ever fell into the hole?</p>

<p>Now for my crude hypothesis: as I fall, and the hole gets smaller, and the curvature near the horizon gets more acute, I'll be racked by tidal forces and blasted by Hawking radiation. Any extended body I happen to have will be disintegrated, so ""I"" will survive only if I'm an indestructible point, and the cloud of such particles is what astronomers see as the final flash of Hawking radiation. Is this even close to plausible?</p>

<p>Consider you are given a function $q:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}^n$ with $\mathcal{M}$ a mathematical space.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When would you assume that $q$ describes the evolution of a mechanical system?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would, if I found or was given a function $\mathcal{L}(x,\dot{x},t)$ such that the Lagrange equations hold for all times $t$ when inserting $q(t)$ for $x$ and $\dot{q}(t)$ for $\dot{x}$, and which I can consider physically plausible. In this case I would interpret $\mathcal{M}$ as physical space, maybe distorted by generalized coordinates.</p>

<p>I would <em>not</em>, if there is provably no such function. In this case $q$ describes the evolution of a general dynamical system, but not a mechanical one.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there mathematically definable conditions on $\mathcal{L}$ for being physically plausible, or possible, let's say? </p>

"1073","How does classical GR concept of space-time emerge from string theory?","<p>First, I'll state some background that lead me to the question.</p>

<p>I was thinking about quantization of space-time on and off for a long time but I never really looked into it any deeper (mainly because I am not yet quite fluent in string theory). But the recent discussion about <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/937/how-does-gravity-escape-a-black-hole/953#953"">propagation of information in space-time</a> got me thinking about the topic again. Combined with the fact that it has been more or less decided that <a href=""http://meta.physics.stackexchange.com/questions/94/level-of-questions-what-do-we-do-now"">we should also ask graduate level questions here</a>, I decided I should give it a go.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>So, first some of my (certainly very naive) thoughts.</em></p>

<p>It's no problem to quantize gravitational waves on a curved background. They don't differ much from any other particles we know. But what if we want the background itself to change in response to movement of the matter and quantize these processes? Then I would imagine that space-time itself is built from tiny particles (call them <em>space-timeons</em>) that interact by means of exchanging gravitons. I drawed this conclusion from an analogy with how solid matter is built from atoms in a lattice and interact by means of exchanging phonons.</p>

<p>Now, I am aware that the above picture is completely naive but I think it must in some sense also be correct. That is, if there exists any reasonable notion of quantum gravity, it <em>has to</em> look something like that (at least on the level of QFT).</p>

<p>So, having come this far I decided I should not stop. So let's move one step further and assume string theory is correct description of the nature. Then all the particles above are actually strings. So I decided that space-time must probably arise as condensation of huge number of strings. Now does this make any sense at all? To make it more precise (and also to ask something in case it doesn't make a sense), I have two questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>In what way does the classical space-time arise as a limit in the string theory? Try to give a clear, conceptual description of this process. I don't mind some equations, but I want mainly ideas.</p></li>
  <li><p>Is there a good introduction into this subject? If so, what is it? If not, where else can I learn about this stuff?</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Regarding 2., I would prefer something not too advanced. But to give you an idea of what kind of literature might be appropriate for my level: I already now something about classical strings, how to quantize them (in different quantization schemes) and some bits about the role of CFT on the worldsheets. Also I have a qualitative overview of different types of string theories and also a little quantitative knowledge about moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau manifolds and their properties.</p>

<p>So, is it always possible to do the decomposition of a (regular, of course) field on $\mathbb{R}^3$ into two fields, free-curl and free-divergence?
And on a limited domain?</p>

"1134","Event Horizon violability?","<p>Is the ""event horizon"" of a black hole potentially violable?  Black holes are commonly described as being unidirectional (matter / energy goes in, but doesn't come out), but is the event horizon of a black hole potentially deformable?  That is, in the case of two black holes colliding (let's say), is there not a point when the effective gravitational field between the two black holes ""cancel out"", thereby causing a potential ""escape path"" for light traveling perpendicular to the axis the two black holes are on?</p>

<p>In a more complicated case, consider two black holes of similar mass orbiting each other in a stable configuration; since no matter or energy actually pass the event horizon of a black hole, would the area between the black holes be a potential zone for escape of energy?  (I'm assuming minimal frame dragging effects here.)  And since the black holes would need to rotate at a very high rate of speed to avoid actually colliding, would that not restrict the emission of energy to be along the axis of rotation?</p>

<p>A bit of clarification here; the primary question here is whether or not the gravitational force vectors of the black holes can properly cancel each other out at an appropriate point between them.  If that's the case, then (in a static system) it can be easily determined that there is a plane through that point perpendicular to the axis along which the two black holes exist where the gravitational force vectors are deeply reduced (not zero, of course, except at the precise point where the masses perfectly balance; however, reduced significantly based upon the inverse distance from said axis).  </p>

<p>In an (again static) two black hole system, orbiting material could enter a ""figure eight"" orbit; much of this material would pass through this ""nodal point"" (or very nearby it).  The high speeds and volumes of the material would indicate a large number of collisions; some resultant (high-energy) ejecta from these collisions would result in some (small) quantity of ejecta traveling along the plane of reduced gravitational force.  Now consider the (more dynamically stable) case of stably orbiting black holes; the plane of reduced gravitational force is itself rotating (about the axis of rotation of the black holes); this turns the ""escape plane"" (not entirely just a plane, it having some (small) quantity of thickness) into a line (again, not entirely just a line, but a very thin cone).</p>

<p>The primary point is that that the cancellation of force vectors effectively makes for a ""dimple"" in the event horizon of each of the black holes; that is, the existence of another strong gravitational attractor in close proximity deforms the event horizon of a black hole.</p>

<p>The question is, is there anything which invalidates this analysis?  As mentioned before, frame dragging is a concern; is there anything else which would be a concern?  (I suspect the frame dragging concern would actually be resolved by the mutual forced frame dragging, i.e. the holes' spins would ""synchronize"" because of the mutual frame drag effect.)</p>

<p>If this is a possibility, then does this not imply another means of black hole mass ""evaporation"" other than Hawking radiation?  (And, in fact, wouldn't it imply the type of ""polar jet"" that has been observed?)</p>

"1151","Which direction will Coriolis forces deflect a bubble?","<p>If I throw a ball straight up, it deflects slightly to the west due to Coriolis forces.  If instead I watch a bubble float up in water, is the bubble deflected west, east, or neither?</p>

<p>I think the bubble also moves west, but am not sure.  My reasoning is that the air in the bubble must feel a Coriolis force to the west because it is rising.  Further, as the bubble rises, the water around it moves, and the net motion of the water is down.  Water moving down experiences a Coriolis deflection to the east.  Bubbles move the opposite direction of water, so if the water is moving east, then the bubble should move west.</p>

<p><strike>I don't have any reasonable-sounding counter-arguments, but I'm not completely convinced by my argument, either.</strike></p>

<p><b>Edit</b>: One reason I'm a unsure about this problem is that a bubble does not get thrown outward by a centrifugal force.  Imagine a plastic ball filled with water and spinning fast.  A bubble is sitting in the water in the equatorial place, half way to the edge of the ball.  There's centrifugal force out towards the wall, but the bubble does not move that way.  The bubble moves up the pressure gradient.  The water gets thrown to the wall, and thus there is higher pressure at the wall than at the center.  The bubble moves towards the center.  If a bubble moves counter to the centrifugal force, I should be careful before claiming it moves with the Coriolis force.</p>

He made the statement that it was the biggest explosion of all time (at first I thought this a subtle pun).  This leads me to my question.  What would time have been like at +1 ""moment"" after the big bang?  What I'm trying to ask is, and I hate to say it because I'm afraid I'll sound foolish, did time flow at the same rate?  Wouldn't all that mass in one place have distorted space/time (and why didn't it ""rip"" it)?</p>

<p>If I were inside of that mass with a stop watch, I'm guessing I wouldn't have been able to measure a difference because time would have effected me the same way as it effected all the other space/mass in the area.  I'm guessing I would have to have something inside (the initial Big Bang mass) and something outside measuring time and see if there was a difference (intuitively this feels weird to consider, could I actually place something ""outside"" the ""Big Bang mass"").</p>

<p>Maybe I've said too much, or made the question too complicated.  I apologize if this is the case.</p>

<p>A black hole is a lot of Mass collapsed into a small space.  I believe that as mass increases time dilation increases.  I remember hearing that if you fell into a black hole, you'd never experience the last second of your life...</p>

<p>If this is true of black holes, how did time pass in the mass/energy that is responsible for the big bang?  As the big bang occurred, did time speed up with the expansion of the universe?  I'm trying to explain what I'm getting at by asking more questions related to what I was asking.  I'm trying to understand what time itself looked like.  As I understand it time prevents everything from happening at once.  If time was a line, were the ends smashed together into a point before the Big Bang ?  Maybe as mass/energy expanded the ""time line"" expanded too?</p>

"1205","How does a steady wind flow generate sound?","<p>When a wind blow through sharp edge, say, edge of a paper, you can see the vibration of the paper and hear the sound.</p>

<p>For this type of oscillation, it should be a damped oscillation with external driving force $\mathcal{F}(x)$:</p>

<p>$\ddot{x}+2\lambda\dot{x}+\omega_{0}^{2}x=\mathcal{F}(x,t)$
</p>

<p>with the driving force in the form of sinusoidal $\mathcal{F}(x,t)\sim F\sin(\omega t)$ (It should be a 3D version though). However, if the air flow is really steady, the external force should be constant so there is no oscillation at all from this equation.</p>

<p>A simple guess is that the motion of the paper influence the streamline of air flow so that the pressure gradient provides the exact sinusoidal driving force. This mechanism is reasonable because the propagation of sound wave has the oscillation relationship between the displacement and the pressure. A question here is how the air flow sustain the energy loss due to the damping.</p>

<p>It is also not easy to think of the initial condition as well as external force for these oscillation. So </p>

<p>1) What exactly is the physical mechanism to generate sound when a 'steady' air flowing through a sharp edge?</p>

<p>2) Another similar question is how the driving force act in the resonance in musical instrumental such as pipe? A 'steady' flow of air is also provided somewhere to the pipe, but air oscillates inside the pipe.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: From the answers, people suggest few mechanism for different situations. Few more questions:</p>

<p>3) For static object, Kármán vortex street can form behind the object. So is the sound frequency the same as frequency of vortex generation, or the same as the expansion of the vortex? Sound is a spherical wave propagating outward, so identify the sound frequency should locate the point of generation.</p>

<p>4) Where is sound generated in the situation (1)? Is the sound frequency the same as the frequency of the vibrating paper?</p>

How far would a hockey puck slide in two different cases:</p>

"1268","Did Einstein prove $E=mc^2$ correctly?","<p>In his book ""Einstein's mistakes"" H. C. Ohanian, the author, holds that Einstein delivered 7 proofs for $E=mc^2$ in his life that all were in some way incorrect. This despite the fact that correct proves had been published and mistakes in his proofs were sometimes pointed out to him.  </p>

<p>The first proof e.g. contains a circular line of thought in that it falsely assumes special relativity to be compatible with rigid bodies.<br>
Reference: stated by V. Icke, prof. theoretical astronomy at Leiden University in his (Dutch) book 'Niks relatief': ""Einstein made an error in his calculation of 1905"".</p>

<p>I found a <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.3899v3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">reference on the internet</a> discussing rigid body motion in special relativity. It quotes from Einsteins 1905 paper: “Let there be given a stationary rigid rod ...”. The referenced paper shows that dealing with rigid bodies in special relativity is at least really complicated, so one could argue that a proof for $E=mc^2$ should not use a rigid body.</p>

<p>Do you think Ohanian's statement is true or was/is he biased in his opinion?</p>

"1286","Why does a curling rock curl?","<p>In the game of curling, players ""curl"" a granite ""rock"" (of precise size and roughly a flattened cylinder) down a ""sheet"" of ice towards a target; the ""rock"" will curve in its path in the direction of the motion of the leading edge.  The question here is, what is the mechanism for the curling of the rock?</p>

<p>Standard frictional physics indicates that angular velocity should not have any effect on translational vector; while moving, the bottom surface of the rock is subject to kinetic friction.  Due to frictional deceleration, the leading edge of the rock exerts (slightly) more force on the ice than the trailing edge; this would seem to indicate that the rock would curve in the opposite direction from what it does.</p>

<p>Intuition would indicate that the reason for the curling motion would be due to kinetic friction being modified by velocity; that is, along the ""left"" side of the rock (assuming a rock moving away from the observer) for a rock rotating counterclockwise, the velocity along the ground is slower than for the ""right"" side; if kinetic friction is decreased as velocity increases, this would be a good explanation for the motion.  However, everything I've seen seems to indicate that the coefficient of kinetic friction is constant; is this correct?  If so, what is the reason for the (well-observed) phenomenon?</p>

<p>In the train moving at $V$ relative to ground, there is an object moving at $v$ relative to the frame in the same direction the frame moves. Observer on the ground calculates the object kinetic energy as $\frac{1}{2}m(v+V)^2$. However, another observer on the frame calculates the energy as $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$.

<p>OTOH, all processes in the universe seem to follow an energy economic principle (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics"" rel=""nofollow"">second law of thermodynamics</a>), that is, everything tries to reach a state of lowest energy.</p>

<p>Now I'm wondering if that isn't enough to refute the idea of 4D-ism: For it to be the correct theory about space-time, you'd need a lot more matter (at least) because every point in time must be materialized as a ""solid"" state. That means for everything can happen within what we perceive as ""one second"", one state must be encoded.</p>

<p>Quantum processes happen at attoseconds (10^-18s), so you need <em>at least</em> 10^18 states just to encode one second of the 4D worm.</p>

But even after all this, physics remains to be one of the most challenging subject for many students, including myself. I just dont get it. It seems like it should be so easy.

 third equation corresponding to law of conservation of energy should be introduced.(3rd
 one of the euler equations of inviscid fluid flow).For the third equation we assume that
 the internal energy per unit volume of the fluid is zero.</p>

<p>The video shows a continuous animation zooming out from earth to the entire known universe. It claims to accurately display every star and galaxy mapped so far. At one point in this video [3:00 - 3:15 minutes] it displays this text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The galaxies we have mapped so far.</p>

  <p>The empty areas where we have yet to

<p>At this point, the shape of the ""universe"" is roughly hourglass, with earth at it's centre.</p>

<p>I'm having trouble understanding what this represents and why they shape is hourglass. Is this simply because we have chosen to map in those directions first? Is there a reason astronomers would choose to map in this pattern, or is this something more fundamental about the shape of the universe? Or is it to do with the speed of light reaching us from these distant galaxies?</p>

<p>Continuing on from the hourglass pattern, the cosmic microwave background radiation is represented as a sphere and labelled ""Our cosmic horizon in space and time"". This doesn't help clear anything up. If we can map CMB in all directions, why have we only mapped galaxies in this hourglass shape.</p>

"1486","Is there a conserved quantity that enforces planar orbits in central force motion?","<p>From what I remember, one of the first steps in finding the equations of motion for an orbiting body is to argue that the body's motion has to be restricted to a plane, because the central force has no component perpendicular to the plane defined by the initial position and velocity vectors. (Or equivalently, because the direction of the total angular momentum has to be constant, since there is no torque.) This means that you can choose coordinates such that $\dot\phi = 0$, which makes the third term of this general Lagrangian vanish:</p>

<p>$$L = \frac{1}{2}m\dot r^2 + \frac{1}{2}mr^2\dot\phi^2 + \frac{1}{2}mr^2\dot\theta^2\sin^2\phi - U(r)$$
</p>

<p>For example, this is done in <a href=""http://www.worldforge.org/project/newsletters/July2002/LagrangianP3"" rel=""nofollow"">this derivation</a> around equation (11). (Note: in this post I use the Zwillinger convention for spherical coordinates listed on <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalCoordinates.html"" rel=""nofollow"">MathWorld</a>.)</p>

<p>Now, I could be wrong, but I think there should be a total of three conserved quantities in this problem. If I use the argument in the previous paragraph to impose a coordinate system in which $\dot\phi = 0$, then I can easily identify the energy as the Noether invariant corresponding to time translation invariance, and the angular momentum as the Noether invariant corresponding to rotational invariance around the $z$ axis ($\theta\to\theta + \epsilon$). But I can't think of a third one, and I suspect that the restriction $\dot\phi = 0$ (by the reasoning of the first paragraph) eliminates that third conserved quantity.</p>

<p>So what if I <em>don't</em> use the physical argument from the first paragraph, so that I'm <em>not</em> limited to $\dot\phi = 0$? From the general Lagrangian I've written above, if my intuition is right, I should be able to obtain three conserved quantities from Noether's theorem <em>alone</em>. Of course, the energy is one, and that's still easy to compute; another one should be angular momentum, although that no longer corresponds to $\theta\to\theta + \epsilon$ but to some more complicated transformation. So I guess my question has two parts,</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> What is the symmetry transformation that generates angular momentum when $\dot\phi \neq 0$?</li>
<li><strong>Main question:</strong> Is there another spatial symmetry that generates another conserved quantity? If so, what is it?</li>
</ol>

<p>P.S. I do know there's basically no practical value to this question, since you can always choose coordinates such that $\dot\phi = 0$, but I'm just curious.</p>

In particular <strong>short, intuitive descriptions of the methods used</strong>. Come on, the bounty awaits ;-)</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, this might look like a question into the history of Ising model but actually it's about physics. In particular I want to learn about all the approaches to Ising model that have in some way or other relation to Onsager's solution.</p>

<p>Also, I am asking three questions at once but they are all very related so I thought it's better to put them under one umbrella. If you think it would be better to split please let me know.</p>

<hr>

<p>When reading articles and listening to lectures one often encounters so called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model#Two_dimensions_.E2.80.93_Onsager.27s_solution"" rel=""nofollow"">Onsager's solution</a>. This is obviously very famous, a first case of a complete solution of a microscopic system that exhibits phase transition.
So it is pretty surprising that each time I hear about it, the derivation is (at least ostensibly) completely different.</p>

<p>To be more precise and give some examples:</p>

<ol>
<li>The most common approach seems to be through computation of eigenvalues of some transfer matrix.</li>
<li>There are few approaches through Peierl's contour model. This can then be reformulated in terms of a model of cycles on edges and then one can either proceed by cluster expansion or again by some matrix calculations.</li>
</ol>

<p>The solutions differ in what type of matrix they use and also whether or not they employ Fourier transform.</p>

<p>Now, my questions (or rather requests) are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Try to give another example of an approach that might be called <em>Onsager's solution</em> (you can also include variations of the ones I already mentioned).</li>
  <li>Are all of these approaches really that different? Argue why or why not some (or better yet, <strong>all</strong>) of them could happen to be equivalent.</li>
  <li>What approach did Onsager actually take in his original paper. In other words, which of the numerous <em>Onsager's solutions</em> is actually <strong><em>the</em> Onsager's solution</strong>.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>For 3.: I looked at the paper for a bit and I am a little perplexed. On the one hand it looks like it might be related to transfer matrix but on the other hand it talks about quaternion algebras. Now that might be just a quirk of Onsager's approach to 4x4 matrices that pop basically in every other solution but I'll need some time to understand it; so any help is appreciated.</p>

I haven't been able to measure the angle it becomes reflective accurately, I estimate about 30-40 degrees. Near this critical point, it can be half and half reflective, where only half becomes a mirror, but it's always either reflective or not - never in between being reflective and non-reflective.</p>

<p>could you just measure the natural linewidth of the photons emitted by the transition between the transient state and the final state and deduce the lifetime of the transient state?

"1536","Separation of variables, eigenfunctions of the Dirac operator","<p><em>Disclaimer: I am not a physicist; I am a geometer (and a student!) trying to learn some physics.  Please be gentle.  Thanks!</em></p>

<p>When solving the Schrödinger equation for a particle in a spherical potential, it seems common to separate variables into angular and radial components.  The angular evolution can then be expressed in terms of eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta$ on the sphere, i.e., the spherical harmonics.  (It is my understanding that these eigenfunctions or eigenstates also have some physical significance, namely that eigenfunctions with the same eigenvalue correspond to states of equal energy.)</p>

<p>When solving the Dirac equation (again with a spherical potential) you'd expect a similar story: separate into angular and radial components and write the angular evolution in terms of the eigenfunctions of the Riemannian Dirac operator $D$ on the sphere.  And, you'd expect these eigenfunctions would have a similar physical interpretation to the non-relativistic case (after all, the only thing we changed was the energy-momentum relationship).</p>

<p>However, the references I'm finding on the Dirac equation with central potential write solutions in terms of the <em>spherical spinors</em> $\Omega$, which are themselves simple functions of the spherical harmonics $Y_l^m$.  This situtation seems odd to me because, although eigenfunctions of $D$ are also eigenfunctions of $\Delta$, the opposite is not true.  In particular, $D$ will have both positive and negative eigenvalues, and so eigenspaces with equal value but opposite sign get ""mixed"" when we square $D$ (recall that on, say, Euclidean $R^3$, $D^2=\Delta$).  I'm not sure about the physical interpretation, though, because I don't understand the physical meaning of eigenfunctions of the Dirac operator.</p>

<p>Here are some more concrete questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>what do eigenfunctions of the $D$ represent physically?</li>
<li>why are the spherical harmonics used for separation of variables rather than eigenfunctions of $D$?</li>
<li>alternatively, are there cases where eigenfunctions of $D$ are used to solve Dirac's equation?</li>
</ul>

<p>Pedagogical references are appreciated.  Thanks!</p>

"1540","Relation of angular speed of a rigid body to Euler's Angles","<p>My Question was like this and i have realised few things and still have some doubts</p>

<p>I have a book in which a paragraph goes like this</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now, $\dot\phi$, $\dot \theta$,
  $\dot\psi$ are respectively the
  angular speeds about the space z-axis,
  line of node and the body z-axis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't know how Euler's angles of rotation are even connected with the angular velocity. Since it's my assumption that the the space set of axis remains unchanged, and the body set of axes rotate with the the axis of rotation. According to my assumption, the angular velocity vector components should remain constant w.r.t the space set of axes (not equal but unchanged) and the angular velocity vector is zero w.r.t the body set of axes because the body set of axes is rotating with the axis so the angular velocity is zero.</p>

<p>Even if  the body set of axes were stationary and the rigid body is rotating, would that mean the the components would be connected to the Euler's angle of rotation anyway? I think that Euler's angle are just angles of rotation that transforms the space set of axes into body set of axes.</p>

<p>And I also don't understand what does this 'line of node mean'.</p>

<p>I have come to realize that in Euler's rotation, The space axis is rotated about space Z axis, new space X-axis and,  body Z axis (which is aligned by the new space X axis rotation). Since there is rotation, there is angular speed, and the rotation are $ \phi , \theta ,and \psi $, then obviously the the angular speeds are  $\dot\phi$, $\dot \theta$,
 $\dot\psi$ and the line of node is the new space X-axis from space Z-axis rotation. And there is no rigid body involved. But has this angular velocity got something to do with the rotation of rigid body? Like stability of spinning top?</p>

"1544","Nonlinear optics as gauge theory","<p>the widely used approach to nonlinear optics is a <strong>Taylor expansion</strong> of the dielectric displacement field $\mathbf{D} = \epsilon_0\cdot\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P}$ in a Fourier representation of the polarization $\mathbf{P}$ in terms of the dielectric susceptibility $\mathcal{X}$:</p>

<p>$\mathbf{P} = \epsilon_0\cdot(\mathcal{X}^{(1)}(\mathbf{E}) + \mathcal{X}^{(2)}(\mathbf{E},\mathbf{E}) + \dots)$ .</p>

<p>This expansion <strong>does not work</strong> anymore if the excitation field has components close to the resonance of the medium. Then, one has to take the whole quantum mechanical situation into account by e.g. describing light/matter interaction by a two-level Hamiltonian. </p>

<p>But this approach is certainly <strong>not the most general one</strong>.</p>

<h2>Intrinsically nonlinear formulations of electrodynamics</h2>

<p>So, what kind of nonlinear formulations of electrodynamics given in a Lagrangian formulation are there? </p>

<p>One known ansatz is the <strong>Born-Infeld model</strong> as pointed out by Raskolnikov. There, the Lagrangian density is given by </p>

<p>$\mathcal{L} = b^2\cdot \left[ \sqrt{-\det (g_{\mu \nu})} - \sqrt{-\det(g_{\mu \nu} + F_{\mu \nu}/b)} \right]$
</p>

<p>and the theory has some nice features as for example a maximum energy density and its relation to gauge fields in string theory. But as I see it, this model is an intrinsically nonlinear model for the free-space field itself and not usefull for describing nonlinear matter interaction.</p>

<p>The same holds for an ansatz of the form</p>

<p>$\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4}F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu} + \lambda\cdot\left( F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu} \right)^2$
</p>

<p>proposed by <a href=""http://www.springerlink.com/content/759u2jh547pk107m/"">Mahzoon and Riazi</a>. Of course, describing the system in <strong>Quantum Electrodynamics</strong> is intrinsically nonlinear and ... to my mind way to complicated for a macroscopical description for nonlinear optics. The <strong>question</strong> is: Can we still get a nice formulation of the theory, say, as a mean field theory via an effective Lagrangian?</p>

<p>I think a suitable ansatz could be</p>

<p>$\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4}M^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}$ </p>

<p>where $M$ now accounts for the matter reaction and depends in a nonlinear way on $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, say</p>

<p>$M^{\mu\nu} = T^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F_{\alpha\beta}$
</p>

<p>where now $T$ is a nonlinear function of the field strength and might obey certain symmetries. The equation $T = T\left( F \right)$ remains unknown and depends on the material.</p>

<h2>Metric vs. $T$ approach</h2>

<p>As pointed out by <strong>space_cadet</strong>, one might ask the question why the nonlinearity is not better suited in the metric itself. I think this is a matter of taste. My point is that explicitly changing the metric might imply a non-stationary spacetime in which a <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/13902/does-a-fourier-transformation-on-a-pseudo-riemannian-manifold-make-sense"">Fourier transformation might not be well defined</a>. It might be totally sufficient to treat spacetime as Lorentzian manifold.<br>
Also, we might need a simple spacetime structure later on to explain the material interaction since the polarization $\mathbf{P}$ depends on the matter response generally in terms of an integration over the past, say  </p>

<p>$\mathbf{P}(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{t}R\left[\mathbf{E}\right](\tau )d\tau$  </p>

<p>with $R$ beeing some nonlinear response function(al) related to $T^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}$.</p>

<h2>Examples for $T$</h2>

<p>To illustrate the idea of $T$, here are some examples.<br>
For <strong>free space</strong>, $T$ it is given by $T^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta} = g^{\mu\alpha}g^{\nu\beta}$ resulting in the free-space Lagrangian $\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4}T^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F_{\alpha\beta}F_{\mu\nu} = -\frac{1}{4}F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}$
The Lagrangian of Mahzoon and Riazi can be reconstructed by<br>
$T^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta} = \left( 1 + \lambda F^{\gamma\delta}F_{\gamma\delta} \right)\cdot g^{\mu\alpha}g^{\nu\beta}$.<br>
One might be able to derive a Kerr nonlinearity using this Lagrangian.</p>

<p>So, is anyone familiar in a description of nonlinear optics/electrodynamics in terms of a gauge field theory or something similar to the thoughts outlined here?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

"1557","Accelerating particles to speeds infinitesimally close to the speed of light?","<p>I'm in a freshmen level physics class now, so I don't know much, but something I heard today intrigued me. My TA was talking about how at the research facility he worked at, they were able to accelerate some certain particle to ""99.99% the speed of light"". I said why not 100%, and I didn't quite understand his explanation, but he said it wasn't possible. This confused me. Since the speed of light is a finite number, why can we go so close to its speed but not quite?</p>

<p>Edit: I read all the answers, and I <em>think</em> I'm sort of understanding it. Another silly question though: If we are getting this particle to 99.99% the speed of light by giving it some sort of finite acceleration, and increasing it more and more, why cant we increase it just a <em>little more</em>? Sorry I know this is a silly question. I totally accept the fact we cant reach 100%, but I'm just trying to break it down. If we've gotten so close by giving it larger and larger acceleration every time, why cant we just supply it with more acceleration? And how much of a difference is there between 99.99% the speed of light, and <em>the</em> speed of light? (I'm not really sure if ""difference"" is a good word to use, but hopefully you get what I'm asking).</p>

  <p>Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of a 5.7 MeV α particle emitted from an atomic nucleus whose diameter is approximately $1.6 \times 10^{-14} m$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I know the de broglie wavelength is $\lambda = h / p$. But we dont know p in this case, however we do know the energy. So to relate energy and momentum I use the following formula: </p>

<p>using $m = 6.644 \times 10^{-27}$ and using $ E = 9.13\times 10^{-13}$ gives me a complex solution. (Check WolframAlpha)</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Pursuant to several correct comments I've changed the title to agree with the actual report which is that the recount concerns elliptical galaxies---and I don't know where I got the notion that it concerned dwarf galaxies---but I am leaving my comments below intact as they represent the way I was thinking before I was corrected. Note that we are in fact talking about relatively few very massive galaxies instead of many very light ones, but the questions are largely unchanged.</p>

<p>How great of a magnetic field would you need to transmute other elements into iron/nickel, if that's in fact possible?</p>

<p>The magnetic field near a neutron star, roughly of order 10^10 tesla, is so strong that it distorts atomic orbitals into thin ""cigar shapes"". (The cyclotron energy becomes greater than the Coulomb energy.) Certainly if a solid crystal were placed in such a field it would become very anisotropic, and at some field strength the lattice constant in the direction transverse to the field could become small enough for nuclear fusion rates between the nuclei to become non-negligible.</p>

<p>How high do we need to crank up the field before the nuclei all equilibrate to the absolute energy minimum of iron and nickel in, say, a matter of hours or days?</p>

<p>Update: From <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/152986"">http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/152986</a> it appears that matter in strong magnetic fields forms into strongly-bound 1D chains along the field lines, which are only weakly bound to each other, and the parallel and transverse lattice constants are actually comparable.</p>

<p>What is the final velocity of the rail tank wagon after emptying?  </p>

<p>Simplifications and assumptions:   </p>

<p>Rail tracks lie horizontally, there is no rolling (air) friction, the speed of the water jet from the nozzle is subject to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torricelli%27s_law"">Torricelli's law</a>, the horizontal cross-section of the tank is a constant, the water surface inside the tank remains horizontal.  </p>

<p>Data given:  </p>

<p>$M$ (mass of the wagon without water)<br>
$m$ (initial mass of the water)<br>
$S$ (horizontal cross-section of the tank)<br>
$S\gg s$ (cross sectional area of the nozzle)<br>
$\rho$ (density of the water)<br>
$l$ (horizontal distance from the nozzle to the centre of the mass of the wagon with water)<br>

Then if you assume that the necessary conditions for CPT symmetry are satisfied in our universe, that means there must be time reversal symmetry violation as well. But I'm curious about ways to test time reversal invariance without relying on CPT.</p>

<p>Basically, how could we distinguish between the Standard Model, which predicts T violation, and some hypothetical other theory that matches current experimental results as well as the SM, but in which CPT symmetry does not hold?</p>

"1720","Ice skating, how does it really work?","<p>Okay, some textbooks I came across, and a homework assignment I had to do several years ago, suggested that the reason we can skate on ice is the peculiar $p(T)$-curve of the ice-water boundary. The reasoning is that due to the high pressure the skates put on the ice, it will melt at temperaturs below $273 K$ and thus provide a thin film of liquid on which we can skate. It was then mentioned as fun fact that you could ice-skate on a planet with lakes of frozen dioxide because that gas has the $p(T)$-curve the other way round.</p>

<p>My calculations at that time told me that this was, pardon my french, bollocks. The pressure wasn't nearly high enough to lower the melting point to even something like $-0.5$ degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>I suppose it is some other mechanism, probably related to the crystal structure of ice, but I'd really appreciate if someone more knowledgeable could tell something about it. </p>

"1725","Is crystal momentum really momentum?","<p>Almost every solid state physics textbook says crystal momentum is not really physical momentum. For example, phonons always carry crystal momentum but they do not cause a translation of the sample at all. </p>

<p>However, I learned that in indirect-band-gap semiconductors, we need phonons to provide the crystal momentum transfer to make happen electron transitions between the top of the valance band and the bottom of the conduction band. Along with absorbing or emitting photons, of course. </p>

<p>Photons do carry physical momentum. For the purpose of momentum conservation, it seems that phonons do carry physical momentum as well.</p>

<p>How can we explain this?</p>

<p>========================================</p>

<p>To put it more specifically, I drew a graph to tell the story:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/syVah.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>K (capital) is crystal momentum.</p>

<p>For such transition, photon provides most of the energy transfer (and a little momentum transfer hk, k in lower case), phonon provides most of the momentum transfer (and a little energy).</p>

<p>Similar graphs can be found in most solid state physics textbooks. The picture tells me, either the photon participating in the transition carries crystal momentum, which value is equal to physical moemntum hk, or the crystal momentum itself is a kind of physical momentum.</p>

<p>However, one can prove that a phonon does not carry physical momentum (here I quote Kittel's ""Introduction to Solid State Physics""):</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/AohrD.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>So, how do we explain the momentum transfer in the electron transition aforementioned?</p>

"1734","How much can a laser's position be fine-tuned?","<p>Suppose you wanted to do a time-resolved experiment with a molecular beam traveling at, say, 300 m/s involving a mobile excitation (pump) laser that scans across the length of the molecular beam and a stationary detector.  So the time-resolution of the experiment depends on how precisely the position of the excitation laser can be fine-tuned,  e.g. if the laser can be tuned in the millimeter range, then the time resolution would be in the microsecond time scale.  (Don't worry about the path length of the beam to the detector.  It's reasonable to imagine that one would be interested in obtaining ns accuracy for a system in which nothing happens for several ms).  Also suppose that the velocity distribution of the particles in the beam have a sharp velocity distribution, such that ∆v/v≈0.01.  My question is, then, to what degree of accuracy can the excitation laser's position be fine-tuned using modern optics?  Obviously the intensity, wavelength, and type of laser will have some effect on the answer, but I'm interested in a ballpark figure anyway.  The obvious follow-up question is how, experimentally, does one tune the laser to that level of accuracy?  Would relativistic effects start to be an issue at some point?  And is the velocity distribution (or, for that matter, the measurement of the velocity) actually going to end up being the limiting factor on time resolution in the end?</p>

"1743","What is the pressure between two electric dipole sheets of finite extent?","<p>I have recently become curious about modeling the repulsion of everyday objects in contact with one another.  By repulsion I mean as you attempt to walk through a wall, the pain in your nose suddenly alerts you to the fact that it won't be possible.  I've come up with this exercise:</p>

<p>What is the mutual pressure exerted by two dipole sheets of finite extent, each area $A$, separated by a distance $D$?  Assume $D \gg$ d where the dipole moment $p = ed$ and $e = 1.6\times10^{-19}$.  There are $N$ dipoles per unit area.  Make an order of magnitude estimate for $N$ to represent a density one would find in ordinary matter.  Make a numerical plot for $10^{-10} &lt; D &lt; 10^{-3}$ meters.  </p>

<p>This is a crude electrostatic model of two electrically neutral materials brought close together.  The oppositely oriented dipole sheets are generated by the electronic cloud repulsion and deformation as the two interfaces approach.  It is meant to serve as a quantitative estimate of the <em>maximum</em> distance at which Coulomb repulsion could possibly stop one body from passing through another.  Interface physics is pretty rich, but I wonder how this model does in predicting such pressures.</p>

<p>The patent says it would be able to collect energy from the sun.  Would this actually work?  Why or why not?  Does it need to be in a vacuum?  The patent seems to say that it works better in a vacuum but that it is not required.  Would the plate stay charged after electrons are thrown off, or would they be attracted and drift back to it and neutralize it?  How does the capacitor to earth make this better than a plate hanging in space?  It allows more charge to be stored for the same work function voltage of the metal?</p>

"1756","Interaction ranges in the Standard Model - Electrodynamics vs QCD","<p>as you might know, the Standard Model of physics can be seen as a $U(1)\times SU(2)\times SU(3)$ gauge theory where each symmetry group accounts for different force fields.</p>

<p>The behaviour for the force field of a ""point"" charge in the most simple cases of this model, the electromagnetic interaction expressed as an abelian (elements commute) $U(1)$ theory, is well known and falls of as $r^{-2}$ and is proportional to the total charge of the source. One states that this force is long range as it only falls off polynomial.</p>

<p>Now, the system for the other interactions, the weak and strong ones, is much more complicated since the underlying groups are not abelian which makes the problem intrinsically nonlinear as can be seen from the Yang-Mills equations, $F = DA, DF = 0$ and its dual counterpart. In contrast to electromagnetism, the interaction range falls off rather quickly and different potentials are known to describe different phenomena.</p>

"1763","Electron transitions in an infinite square well","<p>Consider an electron in an infinite square well.

<p>===============================</p>

<p>Thanks for the answers and comments below. Now I realize a quantum dot is more like an atom than a hollow box. But if we consider the theoretical ideal square well, there seems to be no simultaneous eigenstates of both energy and momentum - at least I can't figure it out. </p>

But I think/hope this site has people who can explain the notions involved in a simpler and more intuitive manner.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: Here is a simple example, taken from pg 8 of the reference cited above ...</p>

<p>In a 2D CFT we have correlation functions of fields $ \phi_i(z,\bar z) $, (where $ z = x+\imath y$) at various points on the complex plane. The n-point correlation function can be expanded as:</p>

<p>$$ \left \langle \prod_{a=1}^n \phi_{i_a}(z_a,\bar z_a) \right \rangle = \sum_p | F_{p\; i_{1} \dots i_n}(z_{1} \dots z_n)|^2 $$</p>

<p>Here $p$ labels members of a basis of functions $ F_{p\; i_1 \dots i_n}(z_{1} \dots z_n) $ which span a vector space for each n-tuple $(z_{1} \dots z_n)$</p>

<p>These functions $F_p$ are known as conformal blocks, and appear to give a ""fourier"" decomposition of the correlation functions.</p>

<p>This is what I've gathered so far. If someone could elaborate with more examples that would be wonderful !</p>

"1875","Self Balancing Unicycle","<p>Here is a link to a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=0JOgTKigxGs"" rel=""nofollow"">video of a self-balencing unicycle</a>. I'm curious as to how this works. In particular:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What provides the torque to keep the rider from falling over? I know it's somehow provided by the motor, but this isn't an external torque (if we define the unicycle as our system), and I assume we need an external torque to change the angular momentum of the unicycle. </p></li>
<li><p>If you were to try to ride this thing on ice, I assume that it could not prevent the rider from falling over. Is this correct? </p></li>
<li><p>What would the free body diagrams look like for this unicycle when it is in the act of falling over? When it is righting itself? </p></li>
</ul>

"1888","Balloons and lifting gases","<p>Hydrogen is the lightest element, so it's cable of lifting the most weight in out atmosphere (probably not the best terminology there, but you get the picture)</p>

<p>Would hot hydrogen (in the same sense as hot air) be able to lift even more mass?
Would a higher or lower density of hydrogen in a ballon lift more?
If you could have a balloon which had nothing in it (it was a vacuum inside) would that lift more than a hydrogen balloon?</p>

<p>Basically what are the physics to balloons and lifting?</p>

<p>(really not sure what to tag this, so if someone else could that'd be great)</p>

"1894","Path integral vs. measure on infinite dimensional space","<p>Coming from a mathematical background, I'm trying to get a handle on the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. </p>

<p>According to Feynman, if you want to figure out the probability amplitude for a particle moving from one point to another, you 1) figure out the contribution from every possible path it could take, then 2) ""sum up"" all the contributions.</p>

<p>Usually when you want to ""sum up"" an infinite number of things, you do so by putting a measure on the space of things, from which a notion of integration arises. However the function space of paths is not just infinite, it's <em>extremely infinite</em>. </p>

<p>If the path-space has a notion of dimension, it would be infinite-dimensional (eg, viewed as a submanifold of $C([0,t] , {\mathbb R}^n))$. For any reasonable notion of distance, every ball will fail to be compact. It's hard to see how one could reasonably define a measure over a space like this - Lebesgue-like measures are certainly out.</p>

<p>The books I've seen basically forgo defining what anything is, and instead present a method to do calculations involving ""zig-zag"" paths and renormalization. Apparently this gives the right answer experimentally, but it seem extremely contrived (what if you approximate the paths a different way, how do you know you will get the same answer?). Is there a more rigorous way to define Feynman path integrals in terms of function spaces and measures?</p>

"1898","Do photons gain mass when they travel through glass?","<p>Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that photons slow down when travelling through glass. Does this mean they gain mass? Otherwise, what happens to extra kinetic energy?</p>

<p><em>I understand now that the apparent slowing down is due to electron interactions, does the glass gain weight due to light travelling through it?</em></p>

"1901","If the observable universe were compressed into a super massive black hole, how big would it be?","<p>I understand only a little of general relativity, but that's why I'm here! :)</p>

<p>Consider the hypothetical situation of some extra-terrestrial intelligence pushing all the mass in the observable universe, every last subatomic particle, into a giant black hole. What is the surface area of such an object? For the sake of argument, let's keep this very idealized. Dark energy, whatever it is, can be captured and thrown into the supermassive black hole; assume there's no Hawking radiation causing it to slowly evaporate, etc. </p>

"1906","Kubo Formula for Quantum Hall Effect","<p>I'm trying to understand the Kubo Formula for the electrical conductivity in the context of the Quantum Hall Effect.</p>

<p>My problem is that several papers, for instance the famous <a href=""http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v49/i6/p405_1"">TKNN (1982)</a> paper, or an elaboration by <a href=""http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0003491685901484"">Kohmoto (1984)</a>, write the diagonal entries of the conductivity tensor in the form</p>

<p>$$ \sigma_{xy}(\omega \to 0) = \frac{ie^2}{\hbar} \sum_{E^a &lt; E_F &lt; E^b} \frac{\langle a|v_x|b \rangle \langle b|v_y|a \rangle - \langle a|v_y|b \rangle \langle b|v_x|a \rangle}{(E^a - E^b)^2} .$$
</p>

<p>This is the static limit $\omega\to 0$ and low temperature $T\to 0$. The sum goes over all eigenstates $|a\rangle$ and $|b\rangle$ of the single-particle Hamiltonian. $E_F$ is the Fermi energy. $v_x$ and $v_y$ are the single-particle velocity operators.</p>

<p>However, these papers don't derive this equation, which is unfortunate because the Kubo formula is usually not presented in this form. I have found (and succeeded in rederiving) the following variation instead </p>

<p>$$ \sigma_{xy}(\omega+i\eta) = \frac{-ie^2}{V(\omega + i\eta)} \sum_{a,b} f(E^a) \left( \frac{\langle a|v_x|b \rangle \langle b|v_y|a \rangle}{\hbar\omega + i\eta + E^a - E^b} + \frac{\langle a|v_y|b \rangle \langle b|v_x|a \rangle}{-\hbar\omega - i\eta + E^a - E^b} \right).$$
</p>

<p>This is formula (13.37) from <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0030839939"">Ashcroft, Mermin</a>, though they don't actually prove it. $f(E)$ is the Fermi distribution. A nice derivation is given in <a href=""http://www.springer.com/materials/book/978-3-540-74789-5"">Czycholl</a> (german).</p>

<p>Now, my question is, obviously</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How to derive the first formula from the second?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can see that the first equation arises as the linear term when writing the sum as a power series in $\omega$, but why doesn't the constant term diverge?</p>

"1907","Why CAN we see the new moon at night?","<p>I understand that the Moon's phases are determined by its position in orbit relative to the Sun. (See: <em><a href=""http://www.extremescience.com/zoom/index.php/space/35-space-science/77-about-the-moon"" rel=""nofollow"">Full Story on the Moon</a></em>). The ""shadow"" is not cast by the Earth (a common misconception - this is actually a lunar eclipse), but by the moon's body itself.</p>

<p>It would appear that, in order for the moon to be a new moon, it would have to be somewhere between the Earth and the Sun. However, it would seem that, if we were looking at a new moon, we'd necessarily be looking at the Sun as well.</p>

<p>Why, then, can we sometimes see a new moon at night? Why doesn't it vanish at night for a half-month every month, between its last/first quarters? </p>

"1908","Buckyballs in vacuum","<p>I've read about the idea that buckyballs and other nanostructures could be used to hold drugs and things until they reach certain places in the body and then get released.</p>

<p>So I was wondering, if you created a buckyball in air, so that some molecules that are in air (such as oxygen and nitrogen) were inside the buckyball. if you then put the buckyball in a vacuum, would the air be able to escape, or would it be trapped in the buckyball.</p>

<p>(And vice versa, a buckyball created in a vacuum put into the atmosphere, would any molecules fit through into the buckyball?)</p>

"1909","How does a photon travel through glass?","<p>This was discussed in an answer to a <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/1898/do-photons-gain-mass-when-they-travel-through-glass"">related question</a> but I think that it deserves a separate and, hopefully, more clear answer.</p>

<p>Consider a single photon ($\lambda$=532 nm) traveling through a plate of perfect glass with a refractive index $n=1.5$. We know that it does not change its direction or other characteristics in any particular way and propagating 1 cm through such glass is equivalent to 1.5 cm of vacuum. Apparently, the photon interacts with glass, but what is the physical nature of this interaction?</p>

<p>Let's not consider high-order effects like Rayleigh/Raman scattering.</p>

"1915","What does it mean that the universe is ""infinite""?","<p>This question is about cosmology and general relativity.
I understand the difference between the universe and the observable universe. What I am not really clear about is what is meant when I read that the universe is infinite.</p>

<ul>
<li>Does it have infinite mass or is it
dishomogeneous? </li>
<li>How can the universe
transition from being finite near the
big bang and infinite 14 billion
