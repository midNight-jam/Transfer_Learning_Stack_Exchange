"1","How can I get chewy chocolate chip cookies?","<p>My chocolate chips cookies are always too crisp. How can I get chewy cookies, like those of Starbucks?</p>

<hr>

<p>Thank you to everyone who has answered. So far the tip that had the biggest impact was to chill and rest the dough, however I also increased the brown sugar ratio and increased a bit the butter. Also adding maple syrup helped. </p>

"2","How should I cook bacon in an oven?","<p>I've heard of people cooking bacon in an oven by laying the strips out on a cookie sheet. When using this method, how long should I cook the bacon for, and at what temperature?</p>

"3","What is the difference between white and brown eggs?","<p>I always use brown extra large eggs, but I can't honestly say why I do this other than habit at this point. Are there any distinct advantages or disadvantages like flavor, shelf life, etc?</p>

"5","In a tomato sauce recipe, how can I cut the acidity?","<p>It seems that every time I make a tomato sauce for pasta, the sauce is a little bit too acid for my taste. I've tried using sugar or sodium bicarbonate, but I'm not satisfied with the results.</p>

"6","What ingredients (available in specific regions) can I substitute for parsley?","<p>I have a recipe that calls for fresh parsley. I have substituted other fresh herbs for their dried equivalents but I don't have fresh or dried parsley. Is there something else (ex another dried herb) that I can use instead of parsley?</p>

<p>I know it is used mainly for looks rather than taste but I have a pasta recipe that calls for 2 tablespoons of parsley in the sauce and then another 2 tablespoons on top when it is done. I know the parsley on top is more for looks but there must be something about the taste otherwise it would call for parsley within the sauce as well.</p>

<p>I would especially like to hear about substitutes available in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world where the obvious answers (such as cilantro) are not widely available.</p>

"12","How can I make my Ice Cream ""creamier""","<p>My ice cream doesn't feel creamy enough.  I got the recipe from Good Eats, and I can't tell if it's just the recipe or maybe that I'm just not getting my ""batter"" cold enough before I try to make it (I let it chill overnight in the refrigerator, but it doesn't always come out of the machine looking like ""soft serve"" as he said on the show - it's usually a little thinner).</p>

"28","Storage life for goose fat","<p>When I roast a goose, I decant the fat, strain and freeze it. I typically get a pint or more. This seems to work well, I can chip off suitably-sized pieces from the frozen block and use them as necessary. But is this the best way to store it, and if so, how long can I leave it for in the freezer before it's no longer safe to use?</p>

"32","What's a good resource for knowing what spices are and what to use them in?","<p>I know what spices like garlic and black pepper are, and what foods you typically put them in. But spices like cardamom, rosemary, thyme, paprika, etc., completely elude me. I haven't found a good resource yet that explains all of them. Is there some kind of ""spice cheat sheet"" out there that I can tape to my kitchen cabinet?</p>

"38","Does resting the dough for a long time reduce the need to knead the bread?","<p>In this <a href=""http://www.chefmichaelsmith.ca/en/home/MichaelsJournal/realbreadstory.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a> by Chef Michael Smith, he mentions a recipe where leaving the dough to rest for 18 hours removes the need to knead the bread. Is this a viable alternative? I've tried the recipe and found that the bread was more dense than a properly kneaded dough.</p>

"54","How should I prepare Risotto","<p>I've been watching a lot of Hells Kitchen, and one of the signature dishes that Chef Ramsay has the chefs prepare is Risotto.  This seems like a simple enough dish but often times the seasoned chefs on the show get it wrong.  I'd like to try making this dish at home, so what is the technique I should use to ensure a tasty final result? </p>
